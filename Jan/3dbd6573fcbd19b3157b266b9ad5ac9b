  The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Mr. Omoyele Sowore arrived in Kano on Sunday in preparation for the Northwest congress of the Peoples Redemption Party scheduled to hold on Monday, January 16, 2023. The National Congress amongst other things has been convened to mobilise support for the Sowore/Magashi ticket and seal the alliance between both political parties — the AAC and PRP. An earlier congress of the PRP held in Northeast Gombe had declared support for the presidential candidate of the AAC, Mr. Sowore. This was followed by a joint press conference of the two aligning political parties at the NUJ secretariat in Abuja. Also expected to be in attendance at Monday's Congress are the Northwest chairpersons of the AAC and some principal officers of the party. In December 2022, the AAC and the PRP announced that they were formalising an alliance to liberate millions of Nigerians from the shackles of corrupt and greedy politicians who have held the country hostage for several years. Sowore at a press conference to formalise the union between the two parties in Abuja said the essence of the alliance was to overthrow and take down the evil system of oppression and injustice in Nigeria and put an end to the reign of deceit that had enslaved Nigerians since independence. According to Sowore, the two political parties, the oldest revolutionary party, PRP, and youngest party, AAC, in the country are forming an alliance to overthrow and take down the evil system of oppression in Nigeria. Sowore said, "AAC was the first political party founded by young people. I mean radical elements in Nigeria. It is the first political party in recent history that called for a revolution in Nigeria and carried out that master plan in about thirty (30) cities in 2019.”
