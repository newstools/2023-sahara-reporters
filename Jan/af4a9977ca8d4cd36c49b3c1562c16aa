Atiku had made a similar mistake during his campaign in Plateau State in 2022.  The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday in Lokoja, Kogi State capital during his presidential campaign rally goofed again when he asked his supporters to vote for the ruling opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming general elections. Addressing his supporters during the campaign, Atiku told Nigerians that if they want the next government to benefit them, they should vote for APC before he quickly corrected himself and said PDP. Atiku, who had made a similar mistake during his campaign in Plateau State in 2022, said, “If you want your team in government to benefit you, vote APC-PDP in the presidential election…” Speaking at the party’s campaign rally held at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium in Jos, the Plateau capital, on December 13, 2022, Atiku suffered a gaffe when he asked his supporters to vote for AP before quickly saying PDP. SaharaReporters reported that while giving his speech in Hausa, a local language dominant in the Northern region of the country, Atiku said, “For God’s sake and for the value of this place, ensure that you vote for AP, I mean PDP this time around.” Atiku had earlier defected to the APC from the PDP but rejoined the PDP in December 2017.
