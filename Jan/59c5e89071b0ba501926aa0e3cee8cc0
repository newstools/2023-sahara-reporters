Speaking at a campaign rally in Asaba, Delta State, on Monday, Obi pledged to revitalise the Warri refinery, which had been in disrepair, as well as to complete the East-West road, which had been unfinished for over two decades. If elected president in the February 25 election, Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has promised to retire the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, and the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu. Speaking at a campaign rally in Asaba, Delta State, on Monday, Obi pledged to revitalise the Warri refinery, which had been in disrepair, as well as to complete the East-West road, which had been unfinished for over two decades. Obi urged Nigerians not to elect persons who were known to have looted the treasury of the nation in the past. He said, “We will make Warri Port work again. We will complete the East-West road. They have been building the road for 24 years but we will complete it. “If you put my age and Datti’s age and divide it into two, we are in our fifties. The other people if you put their own they are in their seventies. You know that there is a retirement age. The PDP chairman is 70 years, APC chairman is 70 years. The Labour Party chairman is 52 years old. So it is our turn. We will retire them, we will pay them compensation. “Our government will be one for youth and women. That is why I told you our average age, not these other people we don’t know their age, we don’t know where they were born, we don’t know which school they attended. “I know you heard when they said Peter is stingy. I agree, Nigeria doesn’t want people who will steal their money again. We want to use our money for our people. “This election is about character and people we can trust. Everybody knows the schools I attended. When I was the governor in Anambra everybody knows what I did, all the work I did. When I left government, everybody knows where I live, go and verify."
