SaharaReporters had reported how Vandi, attached to the Ajiwe Police Station in Ajah, Lagos State, killed Mrs Raheem while she was in a car. A criminal trial instituted against Drambi Vandi, the policeman who allegedly killed a Lagos-based lawyer, Mrs. Omobolanle Raheem, on Christmas Day last year will begin today, January 16, 2023. SaharaReporters had reported how Vandi, attached to the Ajiwe Police Station in Ajah, Lagos State, killed Mrs Raheem while she was in a car. A statement issued by the Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), said the trial would be before Justice I. O. Harrison of Lagos State High Court at the Tafawa Balewa Square. It reads: “The trial of ASP Vandi who allegedly killed Raheem on December 25, 2022, on the Ajah Expressway, will begin before Justice I.O. Harrison at the Lagos High Court sitting at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS).” SaharaReporters earlier reported that the state AG, Onigbanjo would lead the prosecution team against the suspected killers of Mrs Raheem. Vandi appeared before Chief Magistrate C.A. Adedayo on December 30, 2022, barely 24 hours after the Police Service Commission approved his suspension. It was ordered that he should be remanded at the Ikoyi custodial facility pending advice of the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions. He will be tried under Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
