Bakare had during a state of the nation address on Sunday, advised Nigerians to reject a candidate who sees the presidency as his entitlement and evades a debate, in apparent reference to APC candidate, Bola Tinubu. The Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has berated his critics who attacked his state-of-the-nation address on Sunday, saying that he was proud to score zero in the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC primary with true identity and original credentials. Bakare had during a state of the nation address on Sunday, advised Nigerians to reject a candidate who sees the presidency as his entitlement and evades a debate, in apparent reference to APC candidate, Bola Tinubu. Reacting to the statement, the media handlers of the APC presidential candidate, Tinubu, tackled the cleric describing him as a paperweight politician who got zero vote in the APC primary last year. Responding to the attack, Bakare lambasted the Lagos politician, saying, “Can someone tell these people that scoring zero in a primary election with one’s true identity and integrity intact as well having original credentials from well-known schools: Primary, Secondary, colleges and University within and outside of this nation is a veritable badge of honour, absolutely legit and unquestionable?" Bakare wondered why the media team decided to respond to a man they tagged a paperweight politician. “Why are they then giving any thought to what I said? Maybe their alleged “paperweight” is too heavy for them to carry." He added, “One of the Special Advisers that I thought had some semblance  of nobility had to utter outright  lies  and  falsehoods  to  satisfy  his paymaster. “He  said  that I did a video asking members of our church to vote  for their candidate  and  then  turned around to ask  them  not  to  vote  for him. Unfortunately, there is no such video containing such falsehood.”
