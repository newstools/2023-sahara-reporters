  The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, has said that other seemingly leading presidential candidates lack the capacity to deliver Nigeria from the current precarious situation. Speaking as a guest at the online interview program 90MinutesAfrica with host Rudolf Okonkwo, the former publisher at SaharaReporters said the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi, is in a state of lethargy. "He (Peter Obi) does not present any new ideas. He doesn't want to ruffle any feathers, and he is a candidate that understands very well that he is being projected as who he is not, but he enjoys it," Sowore said. Also speaking on the other candidates, the activist cum politician said: "Kwankwanso is like what they call 'forming' in Nigeria; he is trying to make it look like he is working. He is like overworking himself, and his engine is obviously overheating. "As for Atiku, he is just there like a ball of wax." "And, of course, Tinubu is falling apart for real," he said. "We were with him in a meeting a few days ago. As soon as he walked into that hall, Tinubu fell asleep. The only time he was awake was the time I mentioned his name during my speech. They kind of nudged him to wake up. He looked in my direction for like maybe 30 seconds, and he went back to sleep and when the event was over, they woke him up, and he left." The AAC candidate also reiterated the statement he made at the signing of the Peace Accord that a section of the media is trying to black out his activities. "Of all the presidential candidates, five are clearly prominent. But what the media does in my case is to reduce it to four. It is their way of denying me the kind of visibility that I deserve," he complained. And as he often ended his campaign speeches, he said, "one day, the table will turn."
