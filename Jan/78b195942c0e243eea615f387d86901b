Egbin Power Plc is the largest power generating station in Nigeria with an installed capacity of 1,320 megawatts consisting of six units each.  Workers of the Egbin Power Plant in Lagos State on Wednesday staged a “peaceful protest” against their poor working conditions and welfare packages, accusing the management of making life difficult for them. The aggrieved workers carried placards with different inscriptions including "Enough is enough. We need good salary structure," "Give us condition of service," "We can't continue to be a slave in our country." Recall that on November 16, 2020, SaharaReporters reported that the workers also protested over the welfare issues. The protesters condemned the attitude of management towards workers, union leaders saying that they have decided to occupy the power plant until their demands were met. In a similar scenario, the aggrieved workers occupied the entrance of the power plant chanting and displaying their placards.
