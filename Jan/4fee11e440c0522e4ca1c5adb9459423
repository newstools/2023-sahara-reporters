According to him, Kanu was needed in the roundtable conversation to discuss the insecurity in the South-East, as insecurity must end insecurity in the region and Kanu needed to be around. The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has demanded for unconditional release of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. Governor Soludo who made the demand in Awka, the state capital, said that he was ready to stand as a surety for the leader of the Biafran group if the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Nigerian government could not release him unconditionally. According to him, Kanu was needed in the roundtable conversation to discuss the insecurity in the South-East, as insecurity must end insecurity in the region and Kanu needed to be around. He said, "I am making a passionate appeal to the Federal Government to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu unconditionally. If he cannot be released unconditionally, I want him released to me and I will stand surety for him. "We need Nnamdi Kanu in the roundtable conversation to discuss the insecurity in the South East. We must end insecurity in the South East and we need Nnamdi Kanu to be around." The governor therefore promised to take care of Kanu while offering to bring him to the Nigerian authorities any time he was needed.
