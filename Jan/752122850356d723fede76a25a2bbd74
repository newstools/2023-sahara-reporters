Jandor said this on Thursday morning during Sunrise Daily, a live Channel TV morning programme. The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos state, Abdul-Azeez Adediran, popularly known as Jandor, has accused the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) of rigging previous elections to defeat his party. Jandor said this on Thursday morning during Sunrise Daily, a live Channel TV morning programme. He said being a former member of the ruling APC gave him an insight into how the elections were manipulated and rigged to ensure the candidates of opposition parties did not win. He said, “2023 election is an election like never before. APC in the state of Lagos, do you know why there are jittering now? Because it is an election where you can't just sit somewhere and write the results. Before now, PDP wins at the polling unit but before getting to coalition centres, things will change. But this can't happen anymore. “One of the things I was busy doing at that corridor was to study the whole thing. While I was busy consulting at that place, I was busy understudying the whole thing. That is why I have been doing what I have been doing and that is why if they hear Jandor, they would run.” The PDP governorship hopeful also stated that he selected his running mate, Funke Akindele based on her competency, not on popularity as widely speculated. Akindele is a popular actress in Nollywood, Nigeria’s movie industry. He said, “I didn't choose Funke because she is a popular face, I chose her because she is qualified to be even if she was to be the governor of the state, what is wrong with her?” “This is someone who has invested so much in this economy, someone who has been an employer of labour in this economy,” he added.
