Prince Harry in his upcoming memoir ‘Spare,’ wrote that he killed more than two dozen people in Afghanistan during his time as a soldier hunting Taliban extremists. A senior Taliban official on Friday said Prince Harry should be brought before an "international court" after "proudly confessing [the] crime" of killing 25 people in Afghanistan.  Prince Harry in his upcoming memoir ‘Spare,’ wrote that he killed more than two dozen people in Afghanistan during his time as a soldier hunting Taliban extremists.  According to The Telegraph, which obtained an excerpt from the book, Harry said the army taught him not to view members of the Taliban as people. He further stated that he is "neither proud nor ashamed” of his kill count as an Apache attack helicopter pilot.   However, Khalid Zadran, the Taliban’s police spokesman in Kabul while reacting in a statement said Prince Harry will always be remembered in Helmand, a province in Afghanistan, adding that Afghans will never forget the killing of their innocent countrymen.  "Prince Harry will always be remembered in Helmand - Afghans will never forget the killing of their innocent countrymen.  "The perpetrators of such crimes will one day be brought to the international court and criminals like Harry who proudly confess their crimes will be brought to the court table in front of the international community.  "Prince Harry’s description of those he had killed as "chess pieces" and that he was "neither proud nor ashamed" of his actions, was "cruel", "barbaric" and that such actions had legitimised the Taliban’s deadly insurgency against NATO troops in Afghanistan.  "Occupying forces in Afghanistan used to start operations under nightfall on our villages. Prince Harry was involved in this and he has taken the lives of dozens of defenseless Afghans.  "The cruel and barbaric actions of Harry and others aroused the Afghan population and led to an armed uprising against them. We call this kind of uprising holy jihad," he added.
