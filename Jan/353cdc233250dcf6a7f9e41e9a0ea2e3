Improvised explosive devices and ambushes continue to pose a major threat to soldiers fighting Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists in Northern Nigeria.  At least four officers of the 25 Task Force Brigade of Operation Hadin Kai have been reportedly wounded after running into an improvised explosive device (IED) in Borno. A counter-insurgency expert, Zagazola Makama, disclosed this in a series of tweets on Tuesday. The troops were said to be on a fighting patrol along Wajiroko-Sabon Road in the Damboa Local Government Area when their vehicle drove over the planted IED. The IED was allegedly planted by Boko Haram insurgents. “At least four soldiers were wounded after a roadside improvised explosive device (IED) struck a convoy of troops during a fighting patrol along Wajiroko-Sabon in Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State on January 30,” Zagazola tweeted. “They were believed to be from Wajiroko under the 25 Task Force Brigade, Operation Hadin Kai. The wounded soldiers were transferred to the Maimalari hospital for medical management.” Improvised explosive devices and ambushes continue to pose a major threat to soldiers fighting Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists in Northern Nigeria.
