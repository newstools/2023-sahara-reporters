A police officer was killed while another sustained injury when gunmen attacked another office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu South Local Government Area of Enugu State.

Over the past few days, offices of the electoral body in the South-East have come under attack, leading to the destruction of the commission’s properties.  National Commissioner and Chairman Voter Education and Information Committee, Festus Okoye confirmed the latest attack in a statement on Monday.  According to him, the security gatehouse was razed but the attackers could not gain access to the main building as a result of the rapid response from the police and Army personnel from the 82 Division.  The state police commissioner and the Resident Electoral Commission were also personally at the scene immediately after they received information about the attack.  “A policeman died as a result of the attack while the other who was also securing the facility sustained injuries and is currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital,” the statement read.
