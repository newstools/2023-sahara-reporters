Osinbajo’s appearance in Kwara will be the first time he will attend Bola Tinubu’s event since the campaign broke in November.  The All Progressives Congress (APC) has debunked postponement of its planned presidential rally scheduled to hold in Ilorin, Kwara State, today, Wednesday. The Local Organising Committee, in a statement by Saadu Salahu on Monday, said the rally was not postponed even though it clashed with President Muhammadu Buhari’s trip to Mauritania. Buhari was scheduled to appear at the rally in Kwara State on Tuesday, however, he would be in the Mauritanian capital for an award ceremony. In the reviewed timetable issued by the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Buhari is to attend presidential campaign rallies in 10 states. He has already attended rallies in Adamawa and Yobe States. It was learnt that Vice-president Yemi Osinbajo is expected to stand in for Buhari at the rally. The Secretary of the Campaign Council, James Abiodun Faleke in a terse statement, noted that the rally would hold as scheduled. "I hereby confirm that the APC Presidential Campaign rally slated for 17/1/23 will hold as scheduled. Please be advised accordingly." Osinbajo’s appearance in Kwara will be the first time he will attend Bola Tinubu’s event since the campaign broke in November. “President Buhari asked Osinbajo to represent him as he would not be available”, said a top source at the Aso Rock Villa on Monday night according to PM Nigeria News.
