  A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Abia state, Mayor Lucky Igbokwe, better known as Don Lulu, has kicked against plans to introduce new contestants in the race to replace Prof. Uche Ikonne who before his death last week was the PDP governorship candidate in the state.  Don Lulu on Tuesday said the new Electoral Act 2022 allows for a fresh primary in the event that a candidate is incapacitated, late or has resigned. He questioned why those who were not part of the primary election held in 2022 would be part of the February 4 contest to replace Ikonne.  “One of the things people are wondering about is, those people coming in as new contestants, they have not gone to the 17 local government areas to consult people, people were not invited, especially the party people, just like we did by moving around the 17 local governments.  “Moving around the 17 local government areas enables you to know the people’s needs, what they want, it’s like interacting with the grass root,” he said.  Don Lulu who was the youth ambassador of Prof. Ikonne Campaign Council questioned the reason for introducing new contestants into the race.  He thanked the national leadership of the PDP for opening the contest for those who took part in the previous exercise that produced Ikonne as the winner.  Don Lulu came second in the contest.  The Abia State leadership of the PDP had micro-zoned its governorship ticket to Isialangwa North, the local government area of the late holder, Ikonne.  There are indications that the chief of staff to the state governor, Chief Okey Ahiwe may be the favoured aspirant.
