The Chairperson of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Board, Lauretta Onochie has insisted that the NDDC Board, will follow the laws that set it up.  SaharaReporters had reported that Onochie proposed to have 18 Special Assistants, amid other controversial moves, which is brewing a crisis in the commission.  But reacting to the report in a face-saving ploy, she denied the report, insisting that it was designed to sow a seed of discord among members of the Board who are united in their resolve to make a difference in the Niger Delta.   In a statement, she released via her Facebook page, she said what she chairs is a board and not a sole administration.  She wrote, "I will continue to insist that the NDDC Board, follow the laws that set it up. Our Plans are to serve #ThePeopleOfNigerDelta. Its a Board, not a Sole Administration.  "We are doing things differently. We will continue to do that.  "God Bless the Niger Delta. God bless Nigeria. Lauretta Onochie. @Laurestar."  Meanwhile, in another statement posted on its website, NDDC Director of Corporate Affairs, Ibitoye Abosede, said, "As the Chairman pointed out, the story is a tissues of lies designed to sow a seed of discord among members of the Board who are united in their resolve to make a difference in the Niger Delta.  "We have always reported the various submissions by the Board members on their being united to work for the Niger Delta.  "The truth is that the Chairman insisted on a drastic reduction in the number of aides attached to Board members, in line with extant rules and regulations of the Federal Government.” It said the “Board will neither be distracted nor divided in its resolve to do things differently and make a difference in the Niger Delta”.
