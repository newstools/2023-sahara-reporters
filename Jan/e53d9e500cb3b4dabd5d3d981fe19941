The viral video shows Iyanya performing his hit song ‘One Side’, in Awka, while standing next to him was a fan who was spraying money directly on his face.  From the video, the action of the fan got the artist upset, hence, he pushed the fan off stage.  Inyanya later tweeted, saying that the fan was slapping his face with the money, describing it as “disrespectful.”  “The guy kept slapping my face with the money and I tried to hold his hand and he continued. First, no matter how much you are spraying, don’t slap someone with it, that’s disrespectful,” Iyanya tweeted.
