The global organisation also stated that the only path for a nation to succeed was through sustainable development which it had been advocating. The UN Deputy Secretary-General and chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group, Amina Mohammed, stated these in a keynote speech she presented at the Nigerian Bar Association state of the national dialogue, with the theme, ‘Security, economy and administration of justice.’ Only three, out of the 18 Nigerian presidential candidates, turned up for the event. They are Omoyele Sowore of the African Action Congress; Peter Umeadi of the All Progressives Grand Alliance; and Al-Mustapha Hamza of the Action Alliance. “As Africa’s leading economy, with the biggest port of views, and security anchor for our neighbours, Nigeria cannot simply afford to fail”, Mohammed said and reminded the judiciary that as members of the Bar, “You have a key role to play to advance the country’s aspiration towards 2023 general elections.” Mohammed said that the UN would support any process that would lead to credible, all-inclusive, free and fair general elections. She insisted that the security of life and property was a responsibility of the government and advised the incoming government to consider the deployment of technology in the fight against crime.
