Some Nigerians on Twitter have lambasted officers of the Department of State Services (DSS) over harassment of a man for allegedly parking his car behind their vehicle at Blake Resort in Abuja on Thursday night. In a video shared on social media, the DSS officers were heard harassing and assaulting a man identified as Asuking despite several pleas from people around the scene. One of the officers was heard begging his colleagues to allow him to handle him by himself. Asuking also narrated how he was assaulted and harassed by the DSS officers. He said, “‪When I got there yesterday, they searched my boot, I didn't drive with speed yesterday. I was really calm. So, when I got there, I packed my car. One security came out and say remove your car and I was like, I want to buy something. I am coming as you can see. “There's no space for me here to park. Before you know, one DSS man, one man that was sitting down that claimed to be DSS without the uniform, without the name tag.” A Twitter user, Oyinkan described the situation as unfair and noted that it was not the first time DSS officers would do that. The user said, “Can’t even believe this this is unfair....... “Asuking was harassed by the DSS at Blake Resort Abuja because he packed his car behind their car. This is something the DSS has been doing for quite a while now and it's getting alarming #AbujaDSS.” “Asuking was harassed by the DSS at Blake Resort Abuja because he packed his car behind their car. #AbujaDSS,” another user, Joker_k1d said. “At AG Blake Resort, Abuja, some DSS guys harassed Asuking because he parked his car behind them. What does this end? #AbujaDSS,” Jennifer also said while sharing the video on her Twitter handle. “DSS guys really misuse their power over innocent Asuking ag Blake. They need to be call to order #AbujaDSS,” another user, Angel urged the Nigerian government. Nigeria's security agencies have been using cruel, antiquated tactics to harass, illegally arrest, and detain Nigerians for several years. In April 2022, comedian, Debo Adebayo, also known as Mr Macaroni, also lamented the oppression of Nigerians by security operatives who carry out illegal arrests and harass innocent citizens. Macaroni who took to his Twitter handle decried the hopelessness of Nigerians whose right to speech is being threatened by security agents who are ready to frame anyone willing to speak against the oppression. The comedian was reacting to several videos shared online of Nigerians complaining of harassment by security operatives. He wrote, “I have seen at least 5 different videos today of security operatives harassing Nigerians. (NPF, EFCC, NDLEA). It’s exhausting really. Especially because when you talk, there are people on standby to accuse you of supporting fraud or drugs. The oppression is too much. “What is more disturbing is that our security operatives know that there are zero consequences for these actions. So why should they stop? We appreciate the good ones among our officers but this harassment and intimidation of the people has to come to an end. Please.” So yesterday night in @BlakeResort at 1346, Ahmadu Bello Way, Garki 2, Abuja.
