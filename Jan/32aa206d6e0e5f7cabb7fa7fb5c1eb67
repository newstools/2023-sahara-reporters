A video has surfaced on the internet of where the daughter of the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, gifted the North West Director of Tinubu/Shettima support group, Baffa Babba Danagundi, the sum of N10 million after the party’s Kano State campaign rally. Speaking in the video posted on YouTube on Thursday by one Jossy Chily, Danagundi said Tinubu’s daughter personally brought the money to him in his house as an appreciation for the outcome of the Kano rally, but he decided to take N1 million from the money and share the rest to the supporters. Danagundi said, "Due to the rally we did yesterday, we have 1,000 members of the committee that look after the affairs of the organisation. We did not relent. We finished yesterday and needed to rest but we said we have no rest because we promised Asiwaju one million votes and the government and the party and the rest, we have another two million votes for Tinubu. We want to keep to that promise and that is why we are not relenting. "What happened actually this morning, Her Excellency branched my house and she said she just came to appreciate me with the sum of N10 million for what she saw. "I'm very happy of course, and I request her to please come with me. She doesn't know what I'm going to do. Your Excellency, these are the people on the field and I decided to give this N10 million that you gave to me to them. I'm taking only N1 million."
