The visit to Lagos was made known by the former Borno State Governor, in a post he made on his Facebook timeline adding pictures of Fayose and himself in his house.  The vice presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Kashim Shettima, on Tuesday, visited the former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose, in his Lagos State residence to seek support ahead of the forthcoming February 25 presidential election in the country. Fayose, who is the camp of aggrieved governors and stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party led by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, had last week avoided the presidential campaign rally of the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in Ekiti State. The visit to Lagos was made known by the former Borno State Governor, in a post he made on his Facebook timeline adding pictures of Fayose and himself in his house. He wrote, “I paid my brother, the former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Peter Fayose a visit. “The great Oshoko welcomed us with warmth and rare camaraderie. Thank you for your support and God bless you for hosting me and my team,” he added. Reacting to Shettima’s visitation to newsmen, Fayose debunked the possibility of him defecting to the ruling party. He said it was normal in election season for politicians looking for support to pay him a visit. He said, “Anybody looking for votes will visit anybody. It is within their rights to do so. Besides, it shows humility for the APC vice presidential candidate to visit the opposition. “The visit shows the level of recognition and relevance that is accorded to me, and I have no apology about that. I am available if anyone comes to visit me. “Don’t forget that I was governor at the same time as Tinubu. Besides, I have said that Asiwaju is a leader in the South-West. “The current Ekiti State governor visited me. I will share pictures of their visits.  I can’t run away from the opposition because of politics. Only God enthrones,” he said.
