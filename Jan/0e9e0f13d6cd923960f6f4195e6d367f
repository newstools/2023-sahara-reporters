A video of the incident shared by Abe's media team showed members of the campaign train fleeing for safety in the midst of the chaos. Senator Magnus Ngei Abe, the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Rivers State, and his campaign team have been attacked by armed men at Akinima, the headquarters of Ahoada-West Local Government. On Monday, Abe and his team were on their way to Akinima for a statewide campaign rally when they were stopped by unknown gunmen. A video of the incident shared by Abe's media team showed members of the campaign train fleeing for safety in the midst of the chaos. Sharing the experience, Abe said, “We went there and they used two vehicles to block the road so we could not get there. Nigeria is a democracy and all of us have the right to go to the people and share our ideas with them. “If you have ruled the people for seven years, the people should be happy with you. If people are not happy with you it is because you are not doing well. Now, you are sending people’s children to come and block other politicians from talking to the people.” The SDP candidate who has been a victim of repeated armed disruption of his campaigns did not mention those he was referring to as masterminds of the latest incident.
