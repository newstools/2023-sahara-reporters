He also said considering the present realities in the country, Obi will not win all the votes from the youth.  A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party and former aviation minister, Osita Chidoka has described the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi as a disruptor and insignificant player in the 2023 election. The ex-minister, who stated on Sunday night in an interview session on Channel TV monitored by SaharaReporters, claimed that the 2023 presidential election is between the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and his party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said it is incorrect to assume that there is a national youth movement supporting Obi's presidential ambition because the majority of the youths are from the Northwest, where Obi is unpopular. He said, “Peter Obi is a disruptor and an insignificant player in the election, but you see the problem is that let me take something like the youth votes, there are 37 million between the ages of 18 and 35. Of this 37 million people, 9 million of them are in the northwest, 36 per cent. There is no national youth movement. 4.1 million of them are in the southeast, 11 per cent which mirrors the total voting structure of the country.” He also said considering the present realities in the country, Obi will not win all the votes from the youth “because the issues before the youth in the south and the youth in the north are different”. “When we were talking about #EndSARS, nobody in the north moved because that was not a problem for them. “The Igbo position for me is that our significant investment in the PDP for 24 years cannot be thrown away overnight. I remain in the PDP and many Igbos remain in the PDP,” he added. General elections will be held in Nigeria on February 25, 2023, to elect the President and members of the Senate and House of Representatives.
