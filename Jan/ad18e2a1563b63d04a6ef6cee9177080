The president was in the state on a two-day visit where he commissioned several projects.  The Nigeria Police Force, Katsina State Command, has arrested eight suspects for “causing a riot” during President Muhammadu Buhari's visit to the North-West state. The president was in the state on a two-day visit where he commissioned several projects. However, the Katsina Police Command spokesman, Gambo Isah, explained on Friday that after the President commissioned the Kofar Kaura underpass and two other projects, the police received information that some miscreants known as Kauraye from Sabuwar Unguwa Quarters were fighting in the Kofar Kaura area and taking advantage of the crowd to steal phones and other valuables. According to Gambo, a police investigation revealed that the mischievous individuals had used children to cause apprehension in the area by throwing stones at police patrol teams deployed to arrest the miscreants in the area. He added that the arrested individuals were assisting the police in their investigation. Meanwhile, the police denied that President Buhari was stoned and booed during his visit. Gambo's statement on Friday was in response to what he called doctored videos circulating online in which the Nigerian leader was booed by a crowd while commissioning the Kofar Kaura Underpass Bridge in the state capital on Thursday. “As a result, the Command is urging the public to disregard the publications/videos as false, doctored, and misleading,” he said.
