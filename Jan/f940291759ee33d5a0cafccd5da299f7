Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke on Friday, paid a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. According to a statement by presidential spokesperson Femi Adesina, Adeleke commended Buhari for being neutral during his state’s governorship election. Since his assumption of office as Governor of the Southwest state, this was his first visit to the seat of power. Commenting on the rationale for visiting the President, the Osun governor said he would go down in history as a major beneficiary of the Electoral Act 2022 signed into law by the President. He said President Buhari’s neutral stance on election matters contributed immensely to the election results that brought him to power. “I had waited patiently for this appointment and was praying fervently for it to happen. It’s a dream come true for me to see you, and have a handshake,” Adeleke said.  “I am a beneficiary of the new Electoral Law you signed, as it paved the way for free and fair elections, ruling out ballot box snatching and stuffing. “The security agencies followed your instruction to be fair and firm, and I am so proud of you. You are a true father, regardless of political party differences.” The requests made by Adeleke include support for infrastructure development, a proposed new economic city and free trade zone, tax credit, and other federal facilities in Osun State. Responding, Buhari promised to consider the requests for assistance made by the new governor.
