Their wedding was slated for Wednesday, January 18, 2023. An intending couple identified as Mba Ifeoma Gloria and Eremezie Tochukwu Martin, have been killed by yet-to-be-identified gunmen at Arondizuogu in the Ideato North Local Government Area of Imo state.  Their wedding was slated for Wednesday, January 18, 2023.  Residents of the community say the duo were in a tricycle when they were attacked by the gunmen who killed all three passengers inside the tricycle.  The incident reportedly occurred on Wednesday evening.  According to the residents, the unknown gunmen specialise in stealing flashy cars and killing their owners.  Imo and other South-East states have witnessed increasing and regular attacks on security agencies and facilities, government institutions and high-profile individuals in recent times. The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) whose leader Nnamdi Kanu, is in detention, has been linked to the deadly attacks in the region. But the group has repeatedly denied its involvement in the attacks.  Recently, a female Lieutenant of the Nigerian Army, P.P. Johnson was abducted by unknown gunmen in Imo.  A video shows the female officer being tortured by gunmen after she was abducted while visiting her grandmother in Aku-Okigwe community.  “She was just conferred with the rank of Lieutenant in the Nigerian Army. She passed out on December 17 after being commissioned from the Direct Short Service Course,” a military source had said.  “She was kidnapped at her home in Ibube. She travelled home for the Yuletide celebration.”  In the clip obtained by SaharaReporters, one of the unknown gunmen was heard threatening to kill the officer for being a member of the Nigerian Army.  He also warned youths against joining the military and other security agencies.  The officer was stripped naked and her hands and legs were tied. She was seated on the ground in a bushy area.
