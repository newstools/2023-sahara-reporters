The former Lagos State governor who used the idiom, “the blind cannot lead the blind” berated Obasanjo over his endorsement of Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) in the February 25 presidential poll.  The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, on Thursday said that former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, is jealous of his (Tinubu’s) achievements. The former Lagos State governor who used the idiom, “the blind cannot lead the blind” berated Obasanjo over his endorsement of Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) in the February 25 presidential poll. Tinubu made this known while speaking at a rally held at the University of Benin Sports Complex in Benin City, the Edo State capital, adding that Obasanjo’s endorsement of of Peter Obi would not work or make any difference in the outcome of the election by February. Tinubu said as Lagos governor from 1999 to 2007, while Obasanjo was President, Obasanjo “punished” him and millions of residents of Lagos by allegedly withholding local government funds that belonged to the nation’s commercial nerve centre. He also accused Obasanjo and his then Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, who was now the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), of corruption, while lleging that both Obasanjo and Atiku seized the Federal Government’s allocation to Lagos and used “Nigeria’s funds” to buy cars for their girlfriends through shady privatisation scheme. “Can that man recommend a leader for you in Nigeria? Is that not sending an agent to pick your pocket?” Tinubu asked thousands of APC supporters at the rally. “A blind leading the blind. I am sorry I am not insulting visually impaired people. But it won’t work, they will end up in the ditch. If I talk about Obasanjo and Obi – one who doesn’t know the way cannot show the way,” Tinubu added.
