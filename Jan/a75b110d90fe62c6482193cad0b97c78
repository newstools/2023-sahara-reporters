In a public notice issued by the management of the banks on Friday, they said that the planned weekend operation was for receiving old naira notes only. At least two Nigerian commercial banks, First Bank Nigeria and Guaranty Trust Bank, have said their branches across the country will operate on Saturday and Sunday to receive old naira notes ahead of the January 31 deadline set by the Central Bank of Nigeria. In a public notice issued by the management of the banks on Friday, they said that the planned weekend operation was for receiving old naira notes only. “This is to notify the general public that all our branches will be open on Saturday and Sunday just to receive cash. “All old Naira notes of series 200, 500 and 1000 will cease to be in use from the 31st of January,” First Bank said in a notice. The CBN had insisted that old notes of N200, N500 and N100 would cease to be in use from January 31. The governor of the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, had said the deadline remains sacrosanct, despite entreaties from different stakeholders that the apex bank should extend the deadline.
