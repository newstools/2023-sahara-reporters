Troops of the Nigerian Army have killed two terrorists in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. Aruwan said the troops neutralised the bandits while on clearance operations across the council, adding that some weapons were also recovered. The statement read, “Troops of Operation Forest Sanity have neutralized two bandits and cleared several hideouts in Chikun LGA. “According to operational feedback to the Kaduna State Government, the troops achieved these breakthroughs during fighting patrols along the Kaboresha-Rijana Forest-Kuzo-Kujeni-Gwanto-Kachia axis. “The troops set up an ambush position along the Gwanto-Kwasau Road, and thus engaged bandits approaching the location on motorcycles. The troops neutralized two bandits and recovered three motorcycles. “The troops also raided bandits camps in the Kutura-Rijana general area. The bandits fled into the forest on sighting the troops, who then destroyed the camps and recovered three motorcycles. “Other items recovered include several sets of military uniforms and bandoliers. The onslaught against bandits is in progress and government appeals to the general public to continue to volunteer useful information. “Receiving the report, Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed satisfaction and commended the troops for their committed efforts which resulted in the latest success.” Many communities in Kaduna have been living at the mercy of terrorists and bandits, who have been killing, maiming and kidnapping residents with reckless abandon.
