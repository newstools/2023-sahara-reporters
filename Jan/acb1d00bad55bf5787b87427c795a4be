The coalition said that the government should respect the rulings of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja and High Court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State capital which both ordered Kanu's unconditional release from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS). A coalition of political parties under the aegis of the Coalition of United Political Party (CUPP), has called on the President Mohammadu Buhari-led Nigerian government to release the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. The coalition said that the government should respect the rulings of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja and High Court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State capital which both ordered Kanu's unconditional release from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS). The spokesperson of the coalition, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, also urged President Buhari to listen to the voice of the United Nations, pointing out that Kanu's release would reduce tension in the country, especially in the South-East and also promote mass participation in the ongoing electoral process. Nigerian Tribune reports that Ugochinyere made the call on Thursday when he addressed newsmen at his country home of Akokwa in the Ideato Local Government Area of Imo State. Ugochinyere, who raised an alarm over Kanu's deteriorating health as revealed by his lawyers, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, appealed to President Buhari to quickly release from detention without further delay. The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Ideato Federal Constituency in the coming general elections wondered why the series of pronouncements by relevant authorities for the unconditional release of the IPOB leader had continued to be treated with contempt and disdain by the federal government. “As a human rights activist and an advocate for justice, equity and fairness, I call on President Muhammadu Buhari to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in the interest of justice, equity and fairness,” he was quoted as saying. He further lamented the persistent security challenges in the country, insisting that the federal government having addressed the agitations of the Niger Delta region, that of the North-East and the Boko Haram sect should equally apply the same measure to deal with those of the South-East to reduce tension in the land.
