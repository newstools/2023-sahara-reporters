Hoodlums suspected to be members of the Peoples Democratic Party have attacked the governorship candidate of the Accord Party in Rivers State, Dumo Lulu-Briggs and his entourage.  Lulu-Briggs and his team were attacked on Saturday during a visit to Etche Local Government Area of the state.  They reportedly went to Etche LGA to ascertain reports of an attack on the Accord Party secretariat in the area when unidentified gunmen attacked his convoy.  Confirming the attack, Lulu-Briggs said, “Our campaign office was attacked by PDP members, organised by the council chairman. We got a very damning report that our party secretariat was attacked.  “So we had to go round to see what was going on in our secretariat. On our way there, the same boys opened fire. They attacked us, destroyed our vehicles. They shot at my vehicle. You can see my car. All my windscreen, and glasses chattered.  “The whole convoy shot at, shot at people. It is terrible. I don’t understand what this has turned into. It’s a jungle state now, lawless place.

It is not by violence, attacking people.  “These things must stop. It is not a kangaroo state. We have a country. I tried to reach the commissioner of police, but I couldn’t get him. But I sent him a message by text. I hope that he will get my message and call me. This nonsense has to stop.”
