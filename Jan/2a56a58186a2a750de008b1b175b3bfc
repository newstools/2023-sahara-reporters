According to him, Nigeria needs the contribution of everyone, including his political rivals, to be great. The presidential candidate of Accord Party, Professor Christopher Imumolen has said he will appoint the ruling All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu his adviser and Peter Obi of Labour Party his minister of trade if elected as Nigeria’s president in February. According to him, Nigeria needs the contribution of everyone, including his political rivals, to be great. The presidential candidate said on Sunday, “The task of rebuilding our country is an onerous one. It is not going to be a one-man show. Everyone who has the idea, and capacity to add value to governance, no matter their background or party affiliations, shall be called upon to do so. “For his adeptness and aptitude as a businessman of no mean standing, I will be appointing Peter Obi, the current Labour Party presidential candidate as my minister of trade and commerce, while Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will serve as an adviser, most probably on the political front for obvious reasons.     “You will agree with me that these men will most be suitable in the roles I have earlier mentioned because of their track records in both their private and public lives. “As I have said, the move is meant to demonstrate that we are all partners in progress in our desire to see our country regain its lost glory, as well as deliver to its millions of citizens the true dividends of democracy. “The move is also meant to send the message that appointments will only be given to those who merit it in the kind of reformist government we are planning to run.”
