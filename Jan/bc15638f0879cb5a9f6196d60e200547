SaharaReporters learnt that at least three persons were injured while no death has been confirmed yet as of the time of filing this report. “Twin dynamite attacks on APC guber rally in Port Harcourt. Three persons have been confirmed injured,” a witness told SaharaReporters. Earlier on Thursday, the APC and its rival party, PDP traded words over alleged denial of use of their campaign venue in the Etche Local Government Area of the state. While the APC mocked the PDP-led government for allegedly sealing off its proposed campaign venue for fear of defeat, the PDP, on its part, lambasted the governorship candidate of the APC in the state, Tonye Cole, saying Rivers people could not rely on his assumed leadership. The spokesman for the Rivers APC 2023 Campaign Council, Sogbeye Eli, had in a statement announced that the sealing of the venue was an alleged expression of fear of defeat by the PDP in the elections. Eli said, “The PDP Council Chairman of Etche Local Government Area, Hon. Obinna Anyanwu, has ordered the sealing of the Tipper Park at Okomoko, hours after the LGA chapter of the All Progressives Congress played host to the kick-off of the state-wide gubernatorial campaigns of Tonye Cole, and his deputy, Dr. Innocent Barikor. “Clearly intimidated and confounded by the overwhelming turnout of Etche APC faithful at the campaign grounds, the anti-democratic elements, who blocked traditional campaign venues across the state via the draconian Executive Orders 21 and 22 issued by Governor Nyesom Wike, could have forced the hands of the Council Chairman, a younger brother to the APC House of Assembly candidate for Etche Constituency 2, Hon Charles Anyanwu, to seal the Park.”
