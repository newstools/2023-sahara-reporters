IPOB in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, alleged that Musa, who was deployed to the division a few months ago, was sent "to pave the way for killer herdsmen." The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has said that the former General Officer Commanding (GOC), 82 Division Nigerian Army, Enugu, Major General Umar Musa, is "a Boko Haram Commander" purposely deployed to the state by the Nigerian government. IPOB in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, alleged that Musa, who was deployed to the division a few months ago, was sent "to pave the way for killer herdsmen." IPOB had in December 2022 accused the GOC and the state police commissioner of working with herdsmen who have been attacking and killing residents of Enugu communities, especially in Eha-Amufu in the Isi-Uzo Local Government Area and its environs. The secessionist group had said that the security heads in the state were deployed to the state to make way for the killer herdsmen. Whereas Major General Umar Musa has been redeployed to the North, IPOB further alleged that the GOC has been replaced with "another Fulani stooge and Igbo hater, Major General Ahmed Chinade, the GOC 6th Division Port Harcourt”. IPOB alleged that the new GOC “was responsible for killing and bombing Biafrans in the coastal region before he was deployed to 82 Division Enugu two days ago”. "We must continue to expose the murderous activities of terrorists collaborating with military officers deployed in our land to pave the way for Islamic jihadist and Fulani conquest agenda. “IPOB and the people of the Eastern Region should not rejoice yet because the newly deployed GOC is an enemy of the Biafra people too.  He will continue the dirty job of his Boko Haram kinsmen in the East," the group said.
