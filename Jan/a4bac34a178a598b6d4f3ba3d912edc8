Recall that the commission had been without a board for nearly four years following some controversies surrounding the leadership of the commission. The Nigerian government on Wednesday inaugurated the governing board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The composition of the NDDC board had been a subject of controversy in recent times, with the inclusion of certain members - an action which had been roundly condemned by Nigerians. Also some Ilaje stakeholders, the oil-producing area of Ondo State are already in court and sued the Buhari administration over the composition of the NDDC board. Recall that the commission had been without a board for nearly four years following some controversies surrounding the leadership of the commission. It could be recalled that the Senate on December 20, 2022, confirmed the nominations of the Chairman and Board members of the commission after President Muhammadu Buhari sent their names in accordance with the NDDC (Establishment) Act, 2008. Speaking during the inauguration, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, charged the members of the board to be above board. Mustapha added that they should work towards policies that would contribute to the coordinated development of the Niger Delta. Also speaking, the Minister of State, Federal Ministry of Niger-Delta Affairs, Mrs Sharon Ikeazu, urged the new board to work towards restoring hope to the people of the region.
