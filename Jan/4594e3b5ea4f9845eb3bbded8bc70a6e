Tinubu was accompanied by Governor Bello Masari of Katsina and some APC governors, according to sources.  The Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, visited President Muhammadu Buhari at Daura, the president’s hometown in Katsina State, on Friday night. Tinubu was accompanied by Governor Bello Masari of Katsina and some APC governors, according to sources. Details of the meeting were not made public but it held about 24 hours after the APC presidential candidate kicked against some policies of the Federal Government, saying they were targeted at him, Daily Trust reports. At the presidential campaign rally of the APC in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, on Wednesday, Tinubu had said, “Let them increase the price of fuel, only them know where they have hoarded fuel, they hoarded money, they hoarded naira; we will go and vote and we will win. Even if they changed the ink on Naira notes. Whatever their plans, it will come to nought. We are going to win.” Tinubu’s comment had sent a wave of shock across the county, with the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) taunting him and the ruling party. But in a statement, Bayo Onanuga, Director, Media and Publicity, APC Presidential Campaign Council, accused the opposition of driving a wedge between Tinubu and Buhari. The presidency has been mute on the issue, which continues to generate interest few weeks to the election. There are speculations that the Daura meeting is about Tinubu’s outburst in Abeokuta. “Tinubu met with governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno State, his Kebbi State counterpart, Abubakar Bagudu before they proceeded to Daura to see the president, though Governor Zulum did not go with them.” “Perhaps Tinubu noticed that wherever they go for campaign, they were facing public harassment, hence the need to urgently meet with the president over the issue,” the source, which pleaded anonymity, said.
