Some party members have accused the Imo governor of being responsible for the crisis rocking the party in Enugu state. As the crisis in the Enugu chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) worsens, former Senate President Ken Nnamani has advised the Imo governor, Hope Uzodibma to desist from attempting to “colonise” the party, especially in the Southeast geo-political zone. Some party members have accused the Imo governor of being responsible for the crisis rocking the party in Enugu state. Nnamani and some other bigwigs of the APC in Enugu State recently boycotted the presidential rally of the presidential candidate of the party, Bola Tinubu, in the state. But while the leaders of the party in Enugu were conspicuously absent, Governor Uzodinma and his Ebonyi counterpart, David Umahi were present in the rally. On Wednesday, the state chairman of the party, Ugochukwu Agballah, constituted a five-man panel to investigate several petitions against Nnamani and two others accused of being involved in anti-party activities. Agballah had vowed to expel Nnamani and two others from the party if found culpable, describing them as a cog in the wheel. But reacting on Thursday, Nnamani blamed the crisis on the “meddlesomeness” of Governor Uzodinma in the party, especially in Enugu State. According to him, the governor attempted to do the same in some other Southeast states, including Anambra but failed. Nnamani, however, noted that Uzodinma will soon realise that Enugu is different from his state, Imo. The former Senate President said, “It will be a grievous error on my part if l dare dignify Governor Hope Uzodinma’s inordinate ambition to build a political colony in the South East. "His meddlesomeness in Enugu politics is not unexpected. He tried such in Anambra and elsewhere and all ended in abysmal failure. It will not be long before he finds out that Enugu is not Imo."
