The commissioners of police concerned are; Frank Mba (Ogun) and Idowu Owohunwa (Lagos). The Nigerian Inspector General of Police (IGP), Alkali Baba, has approved the redeployment of two commissioners of police to Lagos and Ogun States respectively. The commissioners of police concerned are; Frank Mba (Ogun) and Idowu Owohunwa (Lagos). This was stated in a letter dated January 24, 2023, and signed by Hafiz Inuwa, the Assistant Inspector-General of Police to the Police Service Commission (PSC). While Mba, who had served as the Force spokesman and appointed as the Commissioner of Police in charge of the Federal Capital Territory, would be replacing Lanre Bankole in Ogun State, while Owohunwa, former principal staff officer of the IGP, would take over from Abiodun Alabi in Lagos. This comes just over a month before the elections. Nigerians will vote next month to elect a new president to succeed Muhammadu Buhari, who is finishing his second term in office. The posting, according to the letter, was part of a strategy to strengthen the strategic and operational control of the Lagos and Ogun commands. “I am directed to humbly write and forward the proposed posting of the under-mentioned commissioners of police to state commands indicated against their names for the commission’s kind consideration and approval,” the letter reads. “The Inspector-General of Police is deploying the under-mentioned commissioners of police to strengthen the strategic and operational control of the commands.”
