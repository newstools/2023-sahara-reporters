The angry supporters said Atiku promised to give them the sum of N20 million but failed to fulfill his promise. Angry supporters of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have set his campaign face caps ablaze at the front of the Enugu residence of the Anambra born-business billionaire, Prince Arthur Eze. The angry supporters said Atiku promised to give them the sum of N20 million but failed to fulfill his promise. According to a video footage making the rounds on the internet, the irate supporters said that rather than giving them the N20 million for whatever reason they did not explain in the video, they were only given N200 worth face caps. In the video, some of the angry supporters, most of whom were youths, could be heard saying, “This is Arthur Eze house. Video Arthur Eze house let me see. Is the cap of N200 what we want in this country? Burn it. Atiku is a bastard. He promised us N20 million, see our faces like this. God will punish him.” Meanwhile, SaharaReporters gathered that the former Vice President made the N20million promise for mobilisation of supporters in the state for his 2023 presidential ambition.
