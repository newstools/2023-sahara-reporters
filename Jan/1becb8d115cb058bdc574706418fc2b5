The defendant is standing trial on one count of murder, which is contrary to Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.  SaharaReporters had reported that Raheem was shot dead on Christmas Day while she was in a car with her family at Ajah Under-bridge.  Ajah is a popular area in Lagos, along the Lekki-Epe Expressway.  The State Attorney General, Moyosore Onigbanjo, SAN, informed the court on Monday that there was a witness in court and the state was ready to commence trial.  The defence counsel, Adetokunbo Odutola, who did not oppose the application pleaded with the court for an accelerated hearing. A police inspector, Mathew Ahmen who gave his testimony as the first prosecution witness, said Vandi was the leader of their team. The officer said he was sandwiched by Vandi and another officer identified as Inspector Dimini.  He said Dimini flagged down Raheem’s car but its driver did not stop. He said he also flagged down the car but the driver did not stop. He said, “The next thing I heard was a gunshot and I looked back to see what was happening and I saw that a windscreen was falling.  “The next thing I saw again was a dark woman who jumped down from the vehicle and I heard her saying ‘oga, you have killed my sister.’ The woman held him and before I and Dimini could get to them, they had entered the car, locked it and left.”
