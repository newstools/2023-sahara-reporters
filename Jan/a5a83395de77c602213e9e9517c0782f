The Nigeria Police Force, Kano State Command headquarters situated at Bompai, Nasarawa Local Government Area, has been gutted by fire, with many offices and files suspected to be burnt to ashes. The state fire service said it had since deployed assets to the scene to contain the raging fire on the one-storey building of the command. Unconfirmed reports have it that the entire upstairs were caught up with fire except the office of the State Police Commissioner, Mamman Dauda, which is fortified. Although the command spokesman, SP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawaâ€™s phone was switched off as of the time of filing this report, sources said the cause of the inferno could not be immediately verified.
