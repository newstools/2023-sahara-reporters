Recall that the ICPC arraigned Ojerinde on July 6, 2021, in a suit No. FHC/ABJ/CR/97/2021, on an 18-count charge bordering on alleged diversion of public funds amounting N5.2 billion. A former registrar of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Dibu Ojerinde, has been rearrested by the operatives of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) over the alleged N5.2 billion fraud. Recall that the ICPC arraigned Ojerinde on July 6, 2021, in a suit No. FHC/ABJ/CR/97/2021, on an 18-count charge bordering on alleged diversion of public funds amounting N5.2 billion. The anti-graft commission alleged that Ojerinde committed multiple financial frauds while serving as JAMB and the National Examination Council (NECO) registrar. However, Ojerinde pleaded not guilty to the allegations and was granted bail in the sum of N200 million. TheCable reports that on Wednesday, ICPC's witness who is JAMB's former Deputy Director, Jimoh Olabisi, told the Federal High Court, Abuja that the ex-registrar used him to misappropriate the said funds. Olabisi told the court that he was in charge of opening accounts for JAMB and admitted to opening an account in the name of JAMB/J.O. Olabisi in a commercial bank on the instruction of Ojerinde. According to Olabisi, it was through this account that funds were diverted from the governmentâ€™s accounts.
