Nwosu cited the party's breach of its 1998 constitutional provisions that recognise rotational presidency between the north and south. A former Minister of Health and a Board of Trustees (BOT) member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Professor A.B.C. Nwosu has resigned from the board and the party. Nwosu cited the party's breach of its 1998 constitutional provisions that recognise rotational presidency between the north and south. In his letter of resignation addressed to the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu dated January 12, 2023, Nwosu said his exit from the party takes effect from January 12, 2023. The office of the PDP National Chairman has acknowledged receipt of his resignation letter. Nwosu, a prominent Igbo leader from Otolo Nnewi in Anambra State, said in the letter: “This resignation for me is a matter of CONSCIENCE and PRINCIPLE because of the Party’s inability to adhere to the ROTATION  provision in its (PDP) Constitution. “The journey to rotational presidency between the North and South of Nigeria has been a long and arduous one and I have been involved. Nigeria and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) must learn to keep to an agreement reached by a Constituent Assembly (1995); and enshrined in the Party’s (PDP) Constitution (1998).” Nwosu was a founding member of the PDP.
