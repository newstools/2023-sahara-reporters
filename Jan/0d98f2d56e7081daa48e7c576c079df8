Chiloba's lifeless body was seen in a metal box by the side of the road near Eldoret, according to Kenyan Police authorities, BBC reported on Friday. A young fashion designer and LGBTQ activist, Edwin Chiloba has been found dead in Kenya. Chiloba's lifeless body was seen in a metal box by the side of the road near Eldoret, according to Kenyan Police authorities, BBC reported on Friday. According to a police spokesperson quoted in the Star newspaper, the motive for the killing is unknown. A witness said he saw someone in a vehicle without a licence plate leaving a metal box by the side of the road. The police were called, and they went to open the box to find the body. His body was discovered on Wednesday. However, rights groups in Kenya, where gay sex is illegal, are linking it to his sexuality because it has been earlier estimated that more than half of LGBTQ Kenyans have been assaulted. Reacting to Mr Chilobaâ€™s death, a rights advocacy group based in Kenya, galck+ alleged that the deceased was killed because of the hatred other residents exhibited towards the LGBTQ community in the country.     "Words cannot even explain how we as a community are feeling right now. Another soul lost due to hate. You will be missed," the group stated on Twitter.  "Edwin's death reminds us that queer bodies continue to be under attack all over the country," the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission wrote on Instagram.  Tributes on social media describe Chiloba as "an amazing human" and an "iconic fashion designer".  Last month on Instagram Chiloba wrote that he was "going to fight for all marginalised people" saying that he had been marginalised too.  "We don't know for now why he was killed that way. Experts are handling the matter," police spokesperson Resila Onyango is quoted as saying.
