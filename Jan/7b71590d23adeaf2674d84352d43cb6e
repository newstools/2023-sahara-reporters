The Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule has confirmed that there was a bomb blast in a community close to the border between Nasarawa and Benue states.  The governor who revealed this while speaking to journalists on Wednesday narrated that the bombing incident happened on Tuesday at a place where a sizable number of cattle was kept.  The governor, therefore, alleged that his government has been working to ensure peace and stability are restored to the affected community.  He said, “It has to do with some Fulani who got to rescue their cows and after rescuing the cows, there was a bomb blast at the area where they gathered cows to bring them back to Nasarawa state.  “As a result of that, I have been on it all night, trying to solve the matter, Chief of Defence State, Miyatti Allah, all the security agents including our commissioner of people. Our deputy commissioners are on their way to Idoma, to ensure that we continue to down the tension that may generate as a result of this.  “And by the grace of God, we maintain peace in that area where such bombings are taking place.”  Meanwhile, several calls to the spokesperson for the state police command, Ramhan Nansel, seeking more information about the incident were not returned. He has also yet to respond to a text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.  In October 2022, at least 46 people were killed in separate attacks by herdsmen on communities in Benue and Nasarawa states.  About 36 people were shot dead and their houses were burnt in an early morning attack in Gbeji, a community in the Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State. Also, at least 10 people including women and children were reportedly killed in a similar attack on farmers in Gidan Sule, Kardoroko area in the Keana Local Government Area of Nasarawa State.
