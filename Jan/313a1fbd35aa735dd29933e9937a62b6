"The bandits came to his house between 11 pm and 12 am on Wednesday and took him away”. A popular pastor, Apostle Jerry Hinjari has been murdered in Adamawa state, Northeast Nigeria. SaharaReporters learnt that Hinjari, the presiding pastor of Christ Nation International, was murdered between Wednesday night and Thursday morning after he was forcibly taken from his residence, near Eagles Path, Army Barracks Road, in Yola, the state capital. A family member who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity said "the bandits came to his house between 11 pm and 12 am on Wednesday and took him away”. "When they forced their way into the living room, he asked them to name whatever they wanted he would give them; but they didn't say a word, instead, they took him away. "We found his lifeless body on Thursday afternoon around the Malkohi Displaced Persons' camp, on the way to Mayo-Ine," he said. The Adamawa state police command has confirmed the incident through its spokesperson, SP Yahaya Nguroje. He said, "Yes, I can confirm that he (Hinjari) was kidnapped on Wednesday and his remains were discovered the following day. "About now, the commissioner of police, Sikiru Akande has sponsored an investigation to unravel those behind the dastardly act. We assure the good people of the state that the perpetrators would be brought to justice." Abductions and murder of clerics have become a recurring issue in Adamawa. Last July, SaharaReporters reported that gunmen killed a pastor and his two sons and kidnapped his 13-year-old daughter in the state.
