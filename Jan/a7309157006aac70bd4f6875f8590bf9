According to Onanuga, the journalist was not authorised by anyone and was consequently busted and sent out. The All Progressives Congress (APC) has reportedly sent out an Arise TV cameraman from covering its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu's event in Lagos State. Justifying the action, the APC Presidential Campaign Council alleged that the cameraman was caught secretly streaming live its presidential candidate. The APC-PCC Director of Media and Publicity, Bayo Onanuga, who disclosed this in a post via his Twitter handle, described the action of the journalist as espionage.  According to Onanuga, the journalist was not authorised by anyone and was consequently busted and sent out.  Recall that Tinubu had a meeting with business leaders in Lagos on Friday. His tweet reads, “Arise TV cameraman clandestinely streamed live Asíwájú Bola Tinubu’s event in Lagos today. He was not authorised by anyone. He was clearly on espionage, but was busted and sent out. Is journalism by stealth part of the practice by Arise News?” SaharaReporters had reported that APC presidential candidate and its campaign council had been at daggers' drawn with the Arise TV station since an invitation to feature in a town hall programme the station organised for presidential candidates became a controversy.
