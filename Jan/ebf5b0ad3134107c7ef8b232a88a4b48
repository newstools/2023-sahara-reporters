Utomi disclosed this in a tweet on Sunday. A chieftain of the Labour Party and founder of the Centre for Value in Leadership, Prof. Pat Utomi, has urged Nigerians to vote for a presidential candidate they want their children to emulate.  Utomi disclosed this in a tweet on Sunday.  “May we not vote people we would not want our children to be like. If we do we are not citizens. We just may belong to the lower rungs the Greeks called tribesmen or worse, idiots,” he tweeted.  Utomi had claimed the All Progressives Congress (APC) made a mistake by fielding an ailing person to be the candidate of the party in the 2023 presidential election.  He had said that Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo should have been the best candidate for the party instead of Bola Ahmed Tinubu.  “Physically, you can see he is ailing. Let’s not kid ourselves. Let’s be honest,” he had said during an interview on Channels Television.  He also refuted claims by the APC that Tinubu is fit, stating that “American presidents go through medicals.  “Let him (Tinubu) go through medicals with Nigerian doctors and make it (result) public.”
