Sani on Friday stated that such Nigerians were not waiting for direction or directives from their state governors or godfathers on who to vote for. A social critic and federal lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani has said that most Nigerian electorates had already decided on the presidential candidate to vote for in the February 25 presidential election. Sani on Friday stated that such Nigerians were not waiting for direction or directives from their state governors or godfathers on who to vote for. The former Senator, who stated this via a post on his verified Twitter handle, reminded those who were still thinking otherwise that they were living in the past. Sani's post reads, “Most of the electorates have made up their mind on whom to vote for as their president; they are not waiting for direction or directives from their state governors or godfathers. Those who think otherwise live in the past. Just engage a taxi or bus driver in a discussion.” SaharaReporters had reported that Governor Nyesom Wike of River State on Thursday in Oyo State told the people to vote Governor Seyi Makinde during the March governorship election. Wike, who led aggrieved G-5 Governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), told his listeners that his counterpart would inform them their preferred presidential candidate to be voted for in the February 25 poll. He had said, “The people of Oyo have spoken that it is PDP. Vote for Seyi as governor, vote for House of Reps, vote for House of Assemblies. The other one (presidency), Seyi will talk to you."
