The commission said the card would be made available to INEC and it would cancel such registrations. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has alerted Nigerians that any non-Nigerian seen with a voter’s card who claims to be a Nigerian should be reported to the Nigerian Immigration Service who would promptly arrest such fellow. The commission said the card would be made available to INEC and it would cancel such registrations. This was made known by the Commissioner for Information and Voter Education of the commission, Festus Okoye, during an interview on Channels TV. Festus Okoye explained that the cleaning up was an ongoing exercise, adding that the commission would do its best to go into the 2023 general elections with a voters’ register Nigerians would be proud of. He said; “On the issue of the underage voters, this commission published the entire registered voters in Nigeria in various local government areas and all the registration areas. “People have made their objections, complaints and claims. The commission is presently cleaning up the voter register. The cleaning up is an ongoing exercise and we are going to try our best to make sure that we go into the 2023 general elections with a voters’ register Nigerians will be proud of. “In terms of non-Nigerians voting, only validly registered voters will be in the position to vote in the 2023 general elections. Any time Immigration Service sees any non-Nigerian with a voter’s card and claims to be a Nigeria, they should arrest him and make the card available to INEC and we cancel those registrations. “Therefore, Nigerians should be on the lookout. If any non-Nigerian approaches any of the polling unit, they should alert security agencies.”
