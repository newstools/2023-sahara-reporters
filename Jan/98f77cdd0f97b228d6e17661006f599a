Diran Onifade, LP-PCC Head of Media had in a statement said Obi’s car was attacked by hoodlums when he was on his way to the airport after a rally in the state on Monday.  The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has threatened to file a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari over an alleged attack on the campaign train of the Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi in Katsina. Diran Onifade, LP-PCC Head of Media had in a statement said Obi’s car was attacked by hoodlums when he was on his way to the airport after a rally in the state on Monday. “Our candidate had met with women in a townhall and then held a hugely successful rally at the Muhammad Dikko Stadium,” the statement reads “However, on his way to the airport, hoodlums attacked the car our candidate was riding in with heavy stones from his driver’s side, causing substantial damage to the vehicle. To the glory of God, Mr Obi and other occupants of the car were unhurt. “Subsequently, another set of thugs also threw stones outside the stadium which damaged several vehicles including that of our official stage crew.” The campaign council also alleged that the attacks may have been orchestrated by “desperate politicians” over Obi’s outing in the state. Reacting, SERAP in a tweet asked the Buhari-led government to investigate the incident. “The Buhari administration must promptly investigate the reported attack on the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, after a rally in Katsina on Monday. We’ll take legal action if the perpetrators are not immediately arrested and prosecuted,” the civic group stated.
