Nigeria: a Giant crawling like a wingless ant   1  I spent this year’s Christmas At a petro station Some two miles from my NEPA-less* home And immeasurable distance from sanity   The manger was dark When the Wise Men arrived Pious Joseph had no fuel To power the idle generator   Hood-to-boot ahead of my own Were over a hundred cars in motionless  misery Behind, in a grotesque sprawl round a bend Was a multitude of metal I dared not count   The “Subsidy” Saga was in the air again As it did last season and the seasons before “Appropriate Pricing”, “Landing Costs”, “Loading Fees”, and allied jargon  Usurped front pages of the national tabloid Government megaphones blared In the first two days, then went satanically silent The people were left to argue it out   With absent Station Managers whose harvest Increased with every  hike in the hitch Christmas came and went, but not the snaky line Which bit every nerve of the hungry, angry folks   And the nation’s government was blissfully AWOL   2   Boxing day arrived The line grew longer, the tempers shorter Some boxing did occur, with broken noses And dented hoods in the ringless arena   The Station Manager spied the fight From behind the curtain, picked up his bulging bag And vanished through the back door. He would never touch the treasure in his underground tank  Until the selling price had hit the sky Let moralists preach till they lose their lungs “Eat or be eaten”: our nation has a noble motto; The hottest part of Hell is the logical terminus  Of the straight and narrow way…….. Dusk darkened into night Noon’s harmattan heat dived into dusty cold Stubborn odor hanged heavy from unwashed bodies  Petrol lines loomed longer than the longest lanes Bread prices soared in the marketplace The sick screamed a desperate prayer To the god of early grave  Blindly led, corruption-corroded, Nigeria sits on top of a sea of oil With hardly a drop to power its engine A giant crawling like a wingless ant And the nation’s government was blissfully AWOL  *  Without electric power.  NEPA (National Electric Power Authority) is the old name of the current  Power  Holding Company of Nigeria. And it does ‘hold’ the power while the country flounders in darkness.. Niyi  Osundare
