The presidential candidate of Hope Democratic Party (HDP) in the 2019 election, Mr Ambrose Owuru filed the suit before Justice Inyang Ekwo, asking the court to declare him the winner of the election. A Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday threw out a suit seeking to remove President Muhammadu Buhari from office and stop the 2023 elections. The presidential candidate of Hope Democratic Party (HDP) in the 2019 election, Mr Ambrose Owuru filed the suit before Justice Inyang Ekwo, asking the court to declare him the winner of the election. President Muhammadu Buhari and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were listed as the Defendants in the suit. Owuru, who is a lawyer, filed the suit on June 16, 2021 against the Defendants, two years after the presidential election he lost to Buhari. He asked the court to declare that Buhari had been unlawfully occupying the presidential seat and that he is the authentic winner of the 2019 election.  Owuru also asked the court to order his swearing-in as the President of Nigeria. The plaintiff further applied for an order of perpetual injunction restraining Buhari, Attorney General of the Federation and INEC from further organising and conducting the 2023 presidential election to enable him to complete his four-year term when sworn in as President. Delivering its judgment on Monday, Justice Inyang Ekwo, dismissed the suit, describing it as an abuse of court process.  In dismissing the suit, the court also held that the suit was statute barred and an affront to the supremacy of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.
