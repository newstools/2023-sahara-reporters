In 2019, IMN filed a suit against the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) following an order by the government to ban the Movement. A  Federal High Court in Abuja has adjourned the hearing of the case challenging the ban on the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) otherwise known as  'Shi'ites ' to February 7, 2023.  In 2019, IMN filed a suit against the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) following an order by the government to ban the Movement.  The case was scheduled for hearing today (Tuesday) before Justice Emeka Nwite but could not go on due to the judge’s ill health.   The judge told the lawyer through the court registrar that he would not be able to make it to court as a result of his health issues. The development, therefore, led to the adjournment of cases to be presided over by the judge. The IMN lawyer, Haruna Magashi, who spoke to SaharaReporters confirmed the adjournment of the case to February 7, 2023.   Meanwhile, members of the movement staged a peaceful protest at the entrance of the court, displaying placards to demand justice and the release of the passports of their leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenah. The Nigerian government on July 30, 2019, officially proscribed the movement after a court outlawed the group. A human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), condemned the decision of the government and described it as immoral and illegal, adding that it was because of its protests against the disobedience of court orders by President Muhammadu Buhari.
