It was learnt that the woman was in Purdah clothes when the incident occurred on Sunday and this has led to some Muslim youths, scholars and organisations in Ibadan staging a protest to demand the prosecution of the suspect. A source said, “An unfortunate incident happened on Sunday in Ibadan, when the son of a road transport union sneaked into a mosque and raped a ‘Niqobite.’ “This then prompted the concerned Muslim leaders to stage the protest on Monday.” The concerned Muslims were led in the protest by an Ibadan-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Amubieya, Daily Post reports. Another source revealed that the suspect had been arrested. He said, “The thug who raped a Niqobite (Muslim lady in veil) has been identified as Idris, also known as Kesari. “He is the son of a union leader known as Al-Majiri.
