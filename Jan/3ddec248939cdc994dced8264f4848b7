Last Sunday, Obasanjo, via a six-page open letter, appealed to the youth to ensure that they vote the right persons into the various elective posts. Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari has again lambasted ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo for endorsing the Labour Party’s presidential candidate in the forthcoming election coming up in February.  Last Sunday, Obasanjo, via a six-page open letter, appealed to the youth to ensure that they vote the right persons into the various elective posts.  Furthermore, the ex-President openly endorsed Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, claiming that he has an ‘edge’ over his other opponents.  Reacting to Obasanjo’s letter in a recent interview with media personality, Kikelomo Atanda-Owo on her TV show 'Real Talk With Kike', Shehu stated that the former head of state attacks political leaders out of frustration.  Asked why he described Obasanjo as a “morally dirty man” for endorsing Obi, the presidential spokesperson said, “He didn't just endorse Peter Obi, if that’s all he did, then it’s perfectly OK, but for the fact that he also attacked the records of our administration for which reason we felt he needed a reply.  “Ordinarily we leave Obasanjo to say whatever he wants to say and it doesn't affect the achievement of our administration. But the records have to be set and the facts have to be stated, this is why we responded to him.  “Bola Tinubu is the candidate; the party does not have two candidates in this election and the president has state duties in addition to other things he oversees within and outside the party which he can't fail. The candidate is in touch with the president and gives reports and updates from time to time.”
