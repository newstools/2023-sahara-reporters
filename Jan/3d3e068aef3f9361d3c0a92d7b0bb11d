The number of men who snap their todger during sex is swelling, official NHS figures show. Surgeons in the United Kingdom repaired 169 fractured manhoods in the 12 months to April 2022 — up 46 on the year before.  The number of men who snap their todger during sex is swelling, official NHS figures show.  According to the Scottish Sun, experts reckon it may show that more men are using Viagra to make a stand.  Most procedures involve men in their 30s, although two in their 70s had breaks last year.  The repair involves cutting into the penis to stitch the tear.  London-based consultant urologist Gordon Muir said breaks occur during sex when the willy comes out and gets bent on the way back in — usually when the woman is on top.  He said: “Most men feel a pop or crack and lose their erection.  There’s usually bruising. The penis can look like an aubergine.  “If untreated, erectile dysfunction or scarring can cause serious long-term problems.”  Rob Andrews, 32, of Liverpool, snapped his member during a Viagra-fuelled romp with partner Isabella Woolf.  She said: “I jumped on top of him and heard a crack.  “At the hospital, X-rays confirmed a penis break. Fortunately it’s recovered!”
