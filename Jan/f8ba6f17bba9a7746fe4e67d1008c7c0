Nehikhare noted, "The Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu has visited the scene of the attack for on-the-spot assessment and was told that one of the suspects was arrested and he has been helping the police with the investigation to arrest other fleeing members of the kidnapping gang.
