Pele passed away on Thursday.  Global football body, the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) has urged all nations to name one of their stadiums after Pele, the late Brazilian football legend. This was stated by the body president, Gianni Infantino at a 24-hour public wake which began on Monday at the Santos’ Urbano Caldeira Stadium in honour of the three-time World Cup winner. SaharaReporters had reported that Pele passed away on Thursday. His daughter, Kely Nascimento, confirmed the news on Instagram, writing: "Everything we are is thanks to you. We love you infinitely. Rest in peace.” Speaking at the procession, the FiFA President said the best way to immortalise Pele and his impact on football was to make sure his name appear in stadiums in all countries. “We’re going to ask every country in the world to name one of their football stadiums with the name of Pele,” the FIFA president said. According to Maria Lucia do Nascimento, sister of the Brazilian football legend, their mother still “doesn’t know the situation” and remains “in her own world” with little awareness about the news.
