According to the eyewitness who spoke on condition of anonymity, the thugs whose political party affiliation has yet to be ascertained were led by a popular area boy known as Eba. From some video footage made available to SaharaReporters by the eyewitness, police officers armed with guns could be seen retreating from the rally venue as people scampered to safety while some of the officers stood afar and watched the hoodlums have their way. This was not the first time thugs attacked and disrupted PDP campaign rallies. The party has suffered a series of attacks during its political campaign rallies. The PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar’s campaign rally in Maiduguri, Borno State capital was reportedly attacked by suspected thugs in November 2022. The attack reportedly resulted in the hospitalisation of no fewer than 74 persons with a total of 70 vehicles reportedly damaged. The Maiduguri attack occurred three weeks after Atiku’s campaign rally was also attacked in Kaduna, the Kaduna State capital where an unconfirmed number of people was reported injured.
