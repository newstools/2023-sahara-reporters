They also wanted the Nigerian Governors Forum to prevail on governors of Abia, Ekiti, Imo, Ondo states to pay their members over 25 months’ arrears owed their members. The umbrella body of doctors in Nigeria, the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has cancelled its plan to paralyse hospital activities in public institutions. They also wanted the Nigerian Governors Forum to prevail on governors of Abia, Ekiti, Imo, Ondo states to pay their members over 25 months’ arrears owed their members. SaharaReporters had reported that NARD had earlier this month threatened to embark on an industrial action over non-payment of outstanding arrears of the new hazard allowance, non-payment of the consequential adjustment of the minimum wage to some of its members among others. They also wanted an upward review of the medical residency training fund. But on Monday, after the meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the association in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, where they reviewed the progress on their demands, the association shelved the strike. While commending the Federal Government for the timely release of the reviewed circular on the medical residency training fund, the doctors applauded the Minister of Labour and Employment for the other steps taken to upscale the welfare of its members. They also appealed to the Nigeria Governors’ Forum to prevail on the governors of Abia, Ekiti, Imo, and Ondo states, who, according to them, owed salaries of their members ranging from three months to 25 months.
