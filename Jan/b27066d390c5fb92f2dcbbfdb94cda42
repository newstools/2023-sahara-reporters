A report in the media space had claimed that the Shi’ites leader urged members of his movement to get their Personal Voter Cards, PVCs, and vote for Obi next month, February. The leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky has debunked reports of him endorsing the Labour Party, LP’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi. A report in the media space had claimed that the Shi’ites leader urged members of his movement to get their Personal Voter Cards, PVCs, and vote for Obi next month, February. However, the Muslim leader described the viral reports of him endorsing Obi or any other candidate contesting the 2023 presidential election as a falsehood which should be ignored. One of the cleric’s lawyers, Marshall Abubakar of the Falana & Falana Chambers, in a statement noted that the purported endorsement of Obi was fake. Abubakar confirmed that “some presidential candidates” had actually approached the cleric for endorsement, but he refused to endorse them. He noted that his client believed that the ongoing presidential campaign lacked ideology that would move the nation forward. “That is fake news. I can confirm to you that there is nothing of such. Though some presidential candidates have reached out to him, he has refrained from endorsing any of them because he believes the 2023 presidential contest is bereft of ideological leaning,” he added.
