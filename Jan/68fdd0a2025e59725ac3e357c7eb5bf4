Governor Wike who has been at loggerheads with Atiku since after the party's primary election, cautioned that those issuing threats in Abuja should rethink because they would have problems. Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State has berated the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, for issuing threats against him (Wike) and other aggrieved governors. Governor Wike who has been at loggerheads with Atiku since after the party's primary election, cautioned that those issuing threats in Abuja should rethink because they would have problems. Wike issued the warning at the flag-off of construction work on the Elele Internal Roads in the Ikwerre Local Government Area on Monday. He noted that Rivers State could not continue to be a dumping ground, saying that the state stood very strong in the scheme of national affairs, the reason it reciprocated to support given by anyone. According to him, despite the contribution of Rivers State to PDP, the state had nothing to show for it. Wike was quoted as saying, “Let me use this opportunity to tell you. People should understand. Rivers State is very strong as far as this country is concerned. “I have told people. Rivers State is not a dumping ground and will never be a dumping ground. If we give you support, we believe you can reciprocate, so nobody should threaten us, no political party can threaten Rivers State, not one. “So all those who are opening their mouth in Abuja to threaten Rivers State, think twice before you have a problem.”
