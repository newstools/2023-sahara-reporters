Justice Danladi Mohammed of High Court 3 ruled that Senator Abbo cannot seek re-election having been expelled by his ward chapter of the APC. A high court in Yola, Adamawa state on Tuesday, nullified the nomination of Senator Elisha Abbo as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Justice Danladi Mohammed of High Court 3 ruled that Senator Abbo cannot seek re-election having been expelled by his ward chapter of the APC. Justice Danladi held that the embattled senator and APC are bound by the resolution of the Mubi North Local Government Executive Council, dated October 7, 2022, which expelled him, saying that he is not entitled to enjoy any right or privilege accorded to APC members. The Mubi North LG Exco of the party on October 7, 2022, approved the expulsion of the senator as recommended by the party's disciplinary committee. Also, the court further restrained the APC under which the senator is seeking re-election from recognising him as its candidate, saying that he cannot validly be the candidate of the party in the forthcoming general election. It further restrained Abbo from parading himself as the candidate of the party in the Northern Senatorial District in the forthcoming general election. Justice Danladi declared that the court is satisfied with the procedure followed in showing the senator the way out of the party, saying that he was accorded an opportunity to defend himself but deliberately refused to so do. He said that the action of the plaintiffs in suing Abbo is not an internal affair of the party as claimed and that they have the locus standi to institute the action against him since they are registered members of the party. Two APC members, Abdullahi Suleiman and Yusha'u Usman of Kolere and Sabon Layi wards in the Mubi North Local Government Area respectively, sued Abbo and sought an interpretation regarding his status in the APC.
