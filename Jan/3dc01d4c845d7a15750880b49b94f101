A Chief Magistrate Court in Wuse Zone 6, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), had ordered the arrest of Eno. The warrant of arrest issued against Umo Eno, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom State, has been served on the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba. A Chief Magistrate Court in Wuse Zone 6, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), had ordered the arrest of Eno. The governorship candidate is facing charges of “cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.” The complainant in the suit marked CR/94/2022 is one Edet Godwin Etim. The warrant of his arrest was issued by Emmanuel Iyanna, Chief Magistrate, on December 23, 2022. In series of reports in 2022, SaharaReporters exposed how Eno failed to establish that his West African Examinations Council (WAEC) certificate is authentic. In a letter dated 8th April 2022 and signed by T. A. Ademola, WAEC Exams and Records, WAEC confirmed that Eno’s certificate did not exist in its records. “This is to notify you that the certificate No. PO 275878 A for candidate No. 15725119 of December 1983 submitted for certification by you does not exist in our records hence we cannot certify what we did not issue,” the letter had read.
