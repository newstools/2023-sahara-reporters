It accused NNPCL of failing to supply Premium Motor Spirit or petrol to government depots in the state. Civil society organisations in Rivers State have threatened to stage a protest against the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited over the protracted scarcity of fuel bedevilling the state.  It accused NNPCL of failing to supply Premium Motor Spirit or petrol to government depots in the state.  Chairman of civil society organisations in Rivers State, Enefaa Georgewill, in a statement, accused the oil agency of involvement in sharp practices by supplying petrol only to private depots in the state, instead of government-owned depots, thus forcing marketers to buy the products at exorbitant prices.  Georgewill accused NNPCL of causing untold hardship on the citizens, saying marketers buy the product at N280 per litre from private depots and end up retailing it at N350 per litre or above to consumers.  He further alleged that his investigations revealed that the company had been supplying to private depots at a higher price compared with what was expected.  The statement read, “The question now is why is the NNPCL hell-bent in distributing to the private depots rather than the NNPCL depots in Okrika/Eleme axis of Rivers State?  “RIVCSO uses this medium to call on all our CSO affiliates, trade union allies, traders, professionals, students, drivers, road unions and all residents of Rivers State to prepare for protest on Wednesday, 25th January, 2023 by 9am at Isaac Boro Park.  “The protest will commence from Isaac Boro Park to NNPCL office in Port Harcourt.”
