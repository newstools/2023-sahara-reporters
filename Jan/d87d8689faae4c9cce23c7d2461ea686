No fewer than 100 of the insurgents, including their family members surrendered to troops of the Operation Hadin Kai Theatre Command, in Banki and Konduga Local Government Areas of Borno State during the weekend. Boko Haram insurgents have continued to surrender in the terror-troubled North-East as the Nigerian military widens its offensive against terror in the region and around Lake Chad. No fewer than 100 of the insurgents, including their family members surrendered to troops of the Operation Hadin Kai Theatre Command, in Banki and Konduga Local Government Areas of Borno State during the weekend. It was learnt that they surrendered due to the sustained onslaught on their hideouts by the troops as well as the Boko Haram-ISWAP infighting. In recent months, hundreds of terrorists have surrendered to Nigerian troops. The Senior Special Adviser to the Borno State Governor on Security Matters, Brig Gen Abdullahi Ishaq (retd.) had recently claimed since the government started the collaborative non-kinetic approach to the Boko Haram insurgence in 2021, over 82,000 of the fighters and their families had surrendered. He added that more than 3,500 had been reintegrated into their communities. According to him, more than 85 percent of the repentant Boko Haram fighters who have surrendered were forcefully enlisted by the combatant fighters.
