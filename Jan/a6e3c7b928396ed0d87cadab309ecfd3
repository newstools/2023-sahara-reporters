The combined team of Nigeria security agencies has rescued the Magistrate, Mrs Precious Aigbonoga and one other person who was kidnapped during the Edo State train attack. SaharaReporters reported that gunmen attacked the rail station in Igueben Local Government Area of the state on Saturday where at least 20 people were reportedly kidnapped. The kidnappers were reported to have made a demand of N20million for each person in captivity. But addressing journalists on Friday, the Edo State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, said that the police officer who died after the rescue operation of the magistrate, DSP Michael Adams, did not die of gunshots but of undisclosed natural causes. According to him, the rescue team was drawn from the military, police, local vigilante and hunters. He said that the state government was putting heads together with security agencies to ensure that the remaining nine persons in captivity were released unhurt. Nekhihare said, “Mrs Aigbonoga was rescued unhurt but unfortunately, one of the policemen, DSP Michael Adams, involved in the rescued operation died of natural causes after the operation. He wasn’t felled by a bullet. “Also the state deputy governor and directors of all the security agents have paid a condolence visit to the widow and children of the deceased.”
