The journalist has been denied access to his lawyers and family members by the policemen since his arrest. Some lawless policemen attached to the Federal Capital Territory acting on the orders of Senator Elisha Abbo have detained a freelance journalist, Yau Saeed Mubi. Abbo represents Adamawa North in the National Assembly. SaharaReporters gathered that Mubi was arrested on December 27 over a publication on the absence of good governance. The journalist has been denied access to his lawyers and family members by the policemen since his arrest. “The journalist is the owner of Y2S Online TV. He was illegally arrested and detained by the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force from Abuja, FCT Command. They took him to Abuja, detained him since the 27th of December 2022,” a source told SaharaReporters. “The arrest and illegal detention were done with the instruction of Senator Elisha Ishiaku Abbo, the senator representing Adamawa Northern Senatorial District at the National Assembly. Up till now, the police have refused to release Yau Speed Mubi and had declined requests made by his wife, family, associates and well-wishers to see him. “They also seized his liberty by not allowing him access to his phone. He was arrested just because he published people’s opinions on the lack of good governance. We heard Senator Abbo has directed the Commissioner of FCT Command to keep Yau Saeed Mubi till after the 2023 elections.” In 2019, Abbo drew public ire after he was caught on camera battering a woman in a sex toy shop in Abuja. The court later awarded a fine of N50 million against the lawmaker for assault. A few months later, the controversial lawmaker was again caught on camera beating a man identified as Silas Daniel in his Mubi hometown. Silas, an estranged former Personal Assistant (PA) to Abbo, was attacked with machetes, daggers and clubs by thugs on the orders of the lawmaker.
