This was disclosed by the state police command’s spokesperson, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, on Friday. The Nigeria Police Force has confirmed the death of a man, Fubara Onyengi, who was stabbed during a dispute over leftover fuel from a carnival held on New Year day at the Lakeview Phase 2, Amuwo Odofin area of the state. This was disclosed by the state police command’s spokesperson, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, on Friday. According to the Police PPRO, the case was reported at the Estate Police Station in Amuwo-Odofin by the deceased's brother, whose name was not given. He stated that the deceased's brother told police that around 7am on January 1, his brother was stabbed in the throat by someone identified as Sunday. He said, “The deceased brother said his brother gave up the ghost when he was rushed to a private hospital located at Lakeview Phase 2, Amuwo-Odofin.” He said, “Detectives from the police station swiftly visited the scene; the suspect was arrested and the knife allegedly used for the crime recovered. “The scene was photographed and the corpse removed from the private hospital and deposited at the Yaba General Hospital mortuary for autopsy, while investigation continued.” Meanwhile, fuel scarcity has been a problem many Nigerians have been facing in recent times. For instance, the queues for Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, which were gradually abating recently, suddenly re-emerged in December 2022, in many cities, including Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. This made Nigerians face a bleak Christmas as fuel scarcity took a toll on motorists, who hiked their fares. It was gathered that many depots ran out of the product, a development that reduced supplies from depots to retail stations across the country.
