The Sokoto State Command of the Nigeria Police Force says it arrested four suspected bandits in connection with the killing of one Lawali Agajiba, identified as ward chairman of the All Progressives Congress in the state. The Command's spokesperson, DSP Sanusi Abubakar, who disclosed this in statement on Tuesday, dispelled the rumours that Agajiba's killing had anything to do with politics. According to Abubakar, the command received a report on December 31, 2022, of suspected bandits who invaded Gidan Huloti, Tungar Maza, Galadi and Agajibi villages in the Gwadabawa Council area that rustled a large number of cattle and sheep belonging to different households in the said villages. During the attack, according the Command's spokesperson, the bandits shot death one Lawali Agajiba, who was later found to be the ward chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area. “There was a prompt follow-up by the police that led to the interception and recovery of some of the livestock. Four members of the syndicate were arrested while transporting some of the rustled livestock." The command noted that it had already, contacted the council chairmen of Tangaza, Ilella and Bodinga and asked them to inform members of the public whose livestock are missing to come forward with proof of ownership, collect their cows. "The command also seeks the public to provide more credible information on the suspects under investigation as well as others yet to be arrested. “It was purely an act perpetrated by rampaging cattle rustlers who had no boundaries,” he added.
