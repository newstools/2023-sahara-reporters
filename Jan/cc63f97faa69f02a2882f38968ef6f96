The victims are reportedly 40, 49 and 54 years old. The police in Delta State, south-south Nigeria, have rescued three kidnapped victims at Okuvo and Egborede communities, along Warri/Sapele Road. The victims are reportedly 40, 49 and 54 years old. They were rescued unhurt and have been reunited with their families. The police command in a statement by its Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Bright Edafe, said the victims were sighted as they were being dragged into a bush by their kidnappers. He said, "On 31/12/2022, at about 0120hours, while police operatives attached to Orerokpe Division were on visibility patrol duty along Warri/Sapele road by Okuvo and Egborede communities, they sighted some persons being dragged into the bush. “The operatives suspected that they may have been kidnapped, so they trailed them into the bush. The hoodlums, upon realizing that the policemen were closing in on them, opened fire on the team, and the policeman equally responded.” "The hoodlums who could not withstand the firepower of the operatives abandoned the victims and escaped. The victims (names withheld) aged 40yrs, 54yrs and 49yrs respectively, were rescued unhurt and have been reunited with their families. Manhunt for the fleeing suspects is ongoing," the statement added.
