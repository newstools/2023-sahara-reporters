In August 2022, Gboyega Oyetola, former Osun governor, and the APC petitioned the tribunal to challenge the election victory of Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The All Progressives Congress in Osun State has  asked members of the party to embark on a seven-day fasting and prayer session, starting from Friday to seek God’s favour as the Election Petition Tribunal hearing the party’s petition delivers its judgement. In August 2022, Gboyega Oyetola, former Osun governor, and the APC petitioned the tribunal to challenge the election victory of Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Among several issues, Oyetola is contending that there was overvoting in 749 polling units across 10 LGAs of the state. The Justice Tetse Kume-led panel had concluded sitting on the petitions. The panel is expected to deliver its judgement before the end of January. A statement by the APC Acting State Chairman, Tajudeen Lawal, said the exercise is necessary for the party after making “everything legally possible before the tribunal for the retrieval of Oyetola’s mandate” “I believe in the efficacy of prayers and that there are no challenges that are greater than the powers of prayers,” the statement read. “I appeal to APC members not to treat the fasting and prayers session with levity. I am convinced that God will perform wonders through the collective prayers of party members. "It is important for APC members to remember to pray for continuous good health for Oyetola and his deputy, Mr Bennedict Alabi, as well as members of their families during the fasting and prayer session. “Pray for quick restoration of Osun’s lost and dwindling glory among the comity of states in Nigeria.”
