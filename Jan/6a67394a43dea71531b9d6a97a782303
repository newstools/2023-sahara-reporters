During the PDP presidential campaign rally held at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, the Delta state capital, on Tuesday, Melaye said Omo-Agege does not deserve the votes of Deltans and cannot be entrusted with the state treasury. A spokesman for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council, Dino Melaye, has described the Delta state All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Ovie Omo-Agege as a "mace snatcher", saying Deltans won't for him come in the next election. During the PDP presidential campaign rally held at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, the Delta state capital, on Tuesday, Melaye said Omo-Agege does not deserve the votes of Deltans and cannot be entrusted with the state treasury. Omo-Agege is also the Deputy Senate President. Melaye, a former senator who represented Kogi West senatorial district in the 8th National Assembly, said, "Deltans don't want a mace snatcher as a governor come 2023. “Omo-Agege is a mace snatcher as such he is not fit to governor Delta state, he cannot be trusted with the treasury of the state. I am calling on all Deltans to reject Omo-Agege and give your vote to the Speaker of the state House of Assembly and the PDP governorship candidate, Sheriff Oborevwori. He's a trusted man and man of the people anytime any day." The PDP presidential spokesman also took a swipe at the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. He sang songs to mock him, describing him as unfit to run Nigeria. According to Melaye, Nigerians are not ready to repeat the mistakes of the two previous presidential elections by voting for APC again in the 2023 election.  "Baba ‘emilokan’ is unfit, Tinubu is unfit and cannot run Nigeria. Nigerians cannot repeat the mistake of having APC in power again in 2023. PDP is the right answer. APC is associated with killings, suffering, ASUU (Academic Staff Union of Universities) strikes, banditry, Boko Haram, and terrorism. We say no to APC. Never again."
