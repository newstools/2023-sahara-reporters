This was stated by Mr Rex Achumie, Head of Department of Voter Education and Publicity in the Enugu State branch of INEC while speaking with newsmen on Monday in Enugu. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it is currently investigating the viral video of extortion in the Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State during the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). This was stated by Mr Rex Achumie, Head of Department of Voter Education and Publicity in the Enugu State branch of INEC while speaking with newsmen on Monday in Enugu. The video had showed a woman demanding N1000 from each registrant who wanted to pick up their PVCs. She stated in the video that the N1000 was to cover her transportation costs and other stress associated with delivering the cards to a primary school in a local government area. According to Achumie, the woman in question was not an INEC employee or ad hoc employee. He added that none of the people in the video were INEC employees. “INEC wants to unravel how the cards got into the hands of the unscrupulous woman in the first place. “We are looking at getting the Electoral Officer in charge of the area to liaise with his staff to know who actually gave the woman the cards,” he said. Achumie assured that INEC would get a clearer picture of the whole episode by Tuesday as well as “where and whom the woman in question is working for.”
