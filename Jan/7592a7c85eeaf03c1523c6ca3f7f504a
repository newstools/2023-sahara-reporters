SaharaReporters learnt that Okolo was assassinated at a filling station in Obosi where he probably went to fuel his car on Monday.  The assassination of the President General of Obosi community in Idemili North local government area of Anambra State, Ike Okolo, has been linked to the arrest of a cult group leader in the town. SaharaReporters learnt that Okolo was assassinated at a filling station in Obosi where he probably went to fuel his car on Monday. The assailants were said to have trailed him to a fuel station where they riddled his car with bullets, a development that caused a stampede as motorists scampered for safety while the attack lasted. However, a community source told SaharaReporters exclusively that a cult group leader the President General arrested and handed over to the police was behind his assassination. According to the source, "PG's death has been linked to the arrest of a cult group leader. Okolo had complained to me that he was being trailed many times. "The cult leader’s case in court has not being heard since one year. The judge keep postponing and making overtures for settlement to the victims." Lamenting the gruesome murder of Chief Okolo, the source said it appeared that political class was enjoying the bloodletting going on in the South-East and particularly in the state unabated, as nobody wanted to stop the deadly cult gang. According to the source, "no one wants to help stop these South-East deadly cult gangs. The boy (referring to the cult group leader) made threat both verbal and on social media handle when he was released to revenge his arrest. "As I speak to you two security vigilantes that arrested him have also been killed. This happened on Monday.” Meanwhile, the State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, had yet to react to the assassination of the President General or recent killings.
