Some supporters of the ruling All Progressives Congress have insinuated that the youths were sponsored but Sani on Tuesday dismissed the notion. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the 8th Assembly, said in a tweet on Tuesday, “I don’t believe that anyone sponsored the youths to stone the President. “They are supporters who were left to pervasive poverty and misery. “The poverty alleviation program has not reached to them.Where there is hunger there is no restrain.” SaharaReporters reported on Monday that angry youths in Kano, Northwest Nigeria pelted the convoy of President Buhari with stones, causing chaos and unrest in parts of the state. Videos seen by SaharaReporters captured moments when the residents, most especially youths, also stoned a helicopter in the convoy, burnt objects on the road and also damaged some police vehicles with stones during the confusion.  Buhari, who was in the state on a two-day official visit, earlier on Monday inaugurated a bridge at the Hotoro roundabout in the Kano metropolis. The three-step interchange which was financed through an N8 billion bank loan stretches between Kano bypass road and Kano-Maiduguri Road and is named after President Buhari.
