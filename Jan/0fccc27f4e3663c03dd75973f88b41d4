Mike Ozekhome, the lead counsel to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has said that keeping Kanu in detention against court orders was the height of insensitivity. The lawyer stated this while he was being awarded the Doctor of Law (Honoris Causa) degree by the Abia State University, Uturu. He reminded President Muhammadu Buhari that several courts had ordered Kanu's unconditional release and the reason the Buhari government must comply with the court directives, Vanguard reports. He added that the Court of Appeal's ruling ordering Kanu's release also stated that "Kanu should be released immediately and never again to be tried in any Nigerian court." “Buhari should respect court orders by following judgments,” Ozekhome added. In order to improve Nigeria's reputation abroad, he pleaded with Nigerians to pressure Buhari to end any further delays in obeying the court orders. Ozekhome, who said Kanu’s legal team had knocked off all 15 counts of charge against Kanu, said the continued detention of the IPOB was illegal. “This insensitive and uncaring government has kept Kanu in DSS detention in a solitary confinement. This is injustice”, he noted. Ozekhome appealed to President Buhari to free Kanu before leaving office in May.
