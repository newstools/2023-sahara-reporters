The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has declared that "nothing is intrinsically wrong with Nigerians". The 2023 presidential hopeful stated this in post on his verified Twitter handle while congratulating Dr Ije Akunyili, daughter of late Director-General of National Food and Drug Administration and Control, NAFDAC, and former Minister of information, Dora Akunyili, for her appointment as the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) in the USA.  The former Anambra State governor wrote, “I sincerely congratulate my dear sister, Dr Ije Akunyili, on being the first Nigerian to be appointed as the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) in the USA. Such shows that nothing is intrinsically wrong with Nigerians.” SaharaReporters had reported that Jersey City Medical Center appointed Ije Akunyili as the first black Chief Medical Officer of the hospital. Her appointment was announced in a statement released by the centre on Wednesday via its website, stating that Akunyili’s appointment took effect from January 2, 2023. “RWJBarnabas Health is proud to add Dr. Akunyili to its executive clinical leadership team.
