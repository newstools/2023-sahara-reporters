Lt. Ozuowa was reportedly kidnapped alongside some civilians. PRNigeria quoted a military source as saying that “As at the time he was kidnapped, he sent a distress message to Slt Bomadi, the Ag BOO NOP ONITSHA. “The Ag BOO quickly alerted its own troops stationed at various checkpoints along different exit routes from Onitsha. “Also, our own QRF was deployed immediately.
