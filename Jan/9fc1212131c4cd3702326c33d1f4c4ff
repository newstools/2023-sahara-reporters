This, she explained, was because of the important position occupied by Nigeria in Africa and the rest of the world. Laing, who stated this during a meeting with the National Working Committee, NWC, of Peoples Democratic Party, at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja, yesterday,  said:  “This election is very important to Africa and the rest of the world, so the spotlight will be on Nigeria and the UK will be watching closely. “We engage in so many ways, we have spoken with INEC, civil societies, we don’t support any political party, it is for the people of Nigeria to decide who will lead them at the federal level and state levels.  In that spirit, we are meeting all the main political parties. “I met with the chairman in February, this is our second meeting and I will be meeting all the other chairs of the main political parties.”
