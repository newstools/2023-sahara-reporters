The former Abia State Governor said all claims circulating regarding the health status of Tinubu were fabricated by his political opponents. The Nigerian Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, has described Bola Tinubu, the 2023 presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), as healthy because according to him, every Nigerian above 40 years is sick. The former Abia State Governor said all claims circulating regarding the health status of Tinubu were fabricated by his political opponents. “His (Tinubu’s) health is very stable. No man above 40 is not sick. There is not one, no Nigerian above 40 that is not sick,” Kalu said on Political Paradigm, a recorded programme on Channels Television. “These are things you people go to form on the internet. All these things can be forged by political opponents,” he added. Meanwhile, SaharaReporters had reported how the health condition of Bola Tinubu had raised more concerns among his supporters, as the several surgeries he underwent seemed to have “badly affected” his hands in 2021. SaharaReporters learnt that Tinubu’s condition was so critical such that the two hands shook violently and he had had to lean on his guests to pose for photographs. Political supporters and godsons of the APC leader had also travelled to London, United Kingdom, on solidarity visits during his sick leave – including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.
