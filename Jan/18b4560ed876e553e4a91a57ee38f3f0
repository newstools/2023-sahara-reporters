The visit was to seek the association’s support for the presidential bid of his father. He called on the youths to vote for the APC during the February 25 and March 11 general elections.  Seyi, the son of the All Progressives Congress APC’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has said that the youth wing of the APC would work with the Fulani in ensuring that the party wins the general elections. Seyi made this known on Thursday when he visited Alhaji Abdullahi Bodejo, National President, Miyetti-Allah Kautal Hore Association, in company of members of his Tinubu/Shettima support group. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the visit was to seek the association’s support for the presidential bid of his father. He called on the youths to vote for the APC during the February 25 and March 11 general elections. He said, “Let us all go and collect our PVCs before the deadline and vote APC. A vote for Tinubu/Shettima will carry the youth along as a priority as stated in their manifesto.” "The youth wing of the APC would always work with the Fulani in ensuring that the APC wins the general elections.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Tinubu was conferred with the chieftaincy title of “Sokajo Fulbe” (the Ambassador of the Fulani Youth). Bodejo in his response said that the association’s decision to endorse and support a presidential candidate would be subject to the group’s community engagement with stakeholders and community leaders across the country.
