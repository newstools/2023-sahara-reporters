The helmsman of the apex Igbo body in the diaspora made the remarks during a live virtual interactive session moderated by the host of the popular satirical news show, Dr. Damages Show, Rudolf Okonkwo. The Chairman of the World Igbo Congress (WIC), Prof. Anthony Ejiofor has said that the Anambra State Governor, Charles Soludo is supporting the people who are working to ensure that the Igbo people continue to play second fiddle in Nigeria's political contestations.  The helmsman of the apex Igbo body in the diaspora made the remarks during a live virtual interactive session moderated by the host of the popular satirical news show, Dr. Damages Show, Rudolf Okonkwo.  Prof. Ejiofor, who described the statement allegedly made by Atiku Abubakar that he would be the stepping stone to an Igbo presidency, as an “insult to our people”, accused Prof. Soludo of being lukewarm about the common Igbo interest.  “I have great respect for his (Prof. Soludo) academic and intellectual accomplishments but when it comes to common Igbo interest, there is a great divergence there,” Prof. Ejiofor said.  Elaborating on his characterisation of the Anambra State Governor, the WIC chairman said Prof. Soludo “feels Igbos should just wait for a turn that is yet to come”, to become president of Nigeria.  “Unfortunately, the amiable governor is toeing that line of supporting people who are bent on keeping us as second-class citizens in Nigeria. But I do think we have come to a point where we can sit at the table and somebody from our place will be the president of Nigeria,” he asserted.  Also alluding to the recent letter written by the Anambra State Governor in which he insinuated that Peter Obi will not win the 2023 presidential election, Prof. Ejiofor admonished Soludo not to allow himself to be frozen in the past but to look forward to what is coming.
