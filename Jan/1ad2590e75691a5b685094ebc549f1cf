The officials, who stormed the Uche's family house with some personnel of the Nigerian Army, at about 7:30am on Wednesday shot him three times at the head and chest. Members of the South-East outfit, Ebubeagu, have reportedly shot dead the chairman of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) in Ibeme ward, Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State, Comrade David Uche. The officials, who stormed the Uche's family house with some personnel of the Nigerian Army, at about 7:30am on Wednesday shot him three times at the head and chest. After killing him, they allegedly took his body to Federal Medical Centre mortuary Owerri (FMC) where they tagged him an “unknown gunman.” SaharaReporters reliably gathered that the assailants drove a Sienna and a Lexus 300 jeep. An eyewitness who spoke to some journalists in Owerri, Imo State capital, said that residents believed that the assailants were hired by a man who came to settle a score with the him over N100,000 debt. State Chairman of YPP, Victor Diala, who confirmed the incident to journalists in Owerri, condemned the unprovoked killing of the party chieftain. Diala called on the Imo State Government and the security agencies to fish out the perpetrators.  He said: “It happened. The young man was shot right in front of his house. The funny thing is that they took his body to Federal Medical Centre, Owerri (FMC) where they tagged it ‘unknown gunman’.” SaharaReporters’ efforts to speak with the Imo Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Michael Abattam, were unsuccessful as he could not answer his calls or respond to a text message.
