At least 20 Arsenal supporters have been detained by the police in Uganda for taking part in a trophy parade on the street following Sunday's massive victory over Manchester United. The gunners beat United 3-2 with a 90th minute winner from Eddie Nketiah to reinforce their title credentials. The win leaves Mikel Arteta's side five points clear with a game in hand, exactly half way into the season. Baker Kasule told Daily Monitor that a police patrol vehicle pulled in front of them and asked each one of them to disembark and climb the patrol car which was destined for the Jinja Police Station. “I don't know what we have done but we were simply celebrating our victory over rivals Manchester United,” Mr Kasule said. He then added that “they are 20 supporters in total, all from Jinja City.” BBC reports that the fans were wearing the club's red jersey and carrying a symbolic trophy while the police said the crowd didn't have a permit to hold the procession which was a public order offence. "Arsenal fans were travelling in a convoy of five vehicles on Monday morning when they were intercepted by police. One of them was carrying a trophy they had bought at a local store. "I don't know what we have done but we were simply celebrating our victory over rivals Manchester United," Arsenal fan, Baker Kasule, was quoted as saying by the local Daily Monitor news site. James Mubi, the regional police boss and a self-declared Arsenal fan, told the BBC he had not reviewed the fans' charges but wondered why they were celebrating when only half of the matches in the season had been played.
