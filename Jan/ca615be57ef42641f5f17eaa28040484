Sowore stated this while reacting to a statement made by INEC that the prevailing security challenges in the country could lead to the “cancellation/or postponement” of the 2023 general elections billed to start in February. Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) has accused political leaders and the Independent National Electoral Commission of conspiring to install an interim government after the expiration of the current administration of Buhari Muhammadu. Sowore stated this while reacting to a statement made by INEC that the prevailing security challenges in the country could lead to the “cancellation/or postponement” of the 2023 general elections billed to start in February. “If the insecurity is not monitored and dealt with decisively, it could ultimately culminate in the cancellation and/or postponement of elections in sufficient constituencies to hinder declaration of election results and precipitate constitutional crisis,” Mr Yakubu, represented by the Chairman, Board of Electoral Institute, Abdullahi Zuru, said on Monday. Speaking at The Roundtable organised by The Punch, on Wednesday, the AAC presidential candidate explained that INEC was involved in a conspiracy with the political class which cannot win elections in free and fair contests, to confuse Nigerians. He said, “If you are a Nigerian, your attitude to any news must be that there is a conspiracy behind it. “Because I have lived long enough to know that every terrible rumour that started has come to pass. And there have been people in Nigeria within the political scene who have been advocating for an interim government and when I heard INEC saying the election may not hold... “It is the political class, especially those who know this time around that the North is not going to win elections in a free and fair mode. They always come and create doubt and confusion in the minds of the public. And INEC is part of that group.”
