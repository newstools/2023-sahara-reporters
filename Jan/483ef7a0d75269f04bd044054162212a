Obi, who campaigned in Osogbo, the capital of Osun State, on Saturday, told residents that he was “mentally and physically fit to restore Nigeria's lost glory.” The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has urged Nigerians not to vote for a candidate that is not mentally and physically fit to run the affairs of the country. Obi, who campaigned in Osogbo, the capital of Osun State, on Saturday, told residents that he was “mentally and physically fit to restore Nigeria's lost glory.” He advised Nigerians “to investigate the backgrounds of anyone seeking their votes in the upcoming elections.” At the Freedom Park in Osogbo, venue of the rally, Obi urged his supporters to get their Permanent Voter Cards and vote out the old establishment that has destroyed the country. The former Anambra State governor attended a town hall with members of the Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress. Obi’s advice may not be unconnected to the controversies surrounding the health and mental fitness of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The candidate also met with youth and women groups where his wife, Margaret advised women and youths to prioritise future gains over immediate profit in their choice of candidate on February 25. Datti Baba-Ahmed, the Labour Party's vice presidential candidate, also stated that the Obi-Datti administration would use economic, legal, and diplomatic strategies to address the current administration's N77trillion debt, adding that the wave of endorsements for their joint ticket was just the beginning.
