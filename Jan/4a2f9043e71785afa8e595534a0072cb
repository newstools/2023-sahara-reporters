According to Tinubu, he would be elected Nigeria’s next president despite attempts by some persons in the government to sabotage his chances in the February 25 poll.  The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has taken a swipe at the Muhammadu Buhari-led government. According to Tinubu, he would be elected Nigeria’s next president despite attempts by some persons in the government to sabotage his chances in the February 25 poll. He disclosed this on Wednesday during a rally at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Tinubu and President Buhari belong to the same party. Speaking in Yoruba, he said, “Let fuel be expensive, only they know where they keep it. Keep petrol, keep the naira, we will vote and be elected. You may change the ink of naira notes. What you expect will not happen. We will win. “They said petrol will rise to N200/litre and N500/litre, let your mind be at rest. They don’t want these forthcoming elections to hold. They want to scatter it but that won’t be possible. “They thought they could cause trouble; they sabotaged fuel but with or without fuel, with or without motorcycles and tricycles, we will vote and win. This is a superior revolution. “We will take over government through our PVCs. Even if they say there is no fuel, we will trek to the polling units.” Fuel queues have continued to appear and disappear since January this year and Nigerians have been made to cough up as much as N350 for a litre of petrol. Rather than address the issue, the Nigerian government has remained mute.
