Ezekwesili had in a tweet on Tuesday said, “Dear former Vice President Atiku, please ask the handlers of your @Twitter account to stop misleading the public. The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections, Atiku Abubakar, has attacked the former Minister of Education, Obiageli Ezekwesili, for saying that the former Vice President never headed the Nigeria’s Economic Management Team. Ezekwesili had in a tweet on Tuesday said, “Dear former Vice President Atiku, please ask the handlers of your @Twitter account to stop misleading the public. “You were never the Head of the Economic Management Team. This absurd Lie does you no good at all. Please ask your Team to stop it. Happy New Year. Wish you well.” But reacting to Ezekwesili’s comment, Atiku through his spokesperson, Paul Ibe, said that the former education minister only resorted to “jaded aproko pettiness,” and should either “bury her ignorance or advertise her apparent mischief.” Ibe said, “Dear @obyezeks, I know it's political season and people resort to all sorts of antics in support of their preferred candidates. But some things should be considered too low. “It is an established history that @atiku as Chairman, National Economic Council headed the nation’s Economic Management Team between 1999-2007, during which Nigeria had some of her best economic growth. “In trying - and failing - to weaken his standing in public, let us not resort to this sort of jaded 'aproko' pettiness. If Atiku wasn’t head of the Economic Management Team as VP, so who was? You? “This matter is a constitutional provision and you will do well either to bury your ignorance or advertise your apparent mischief. Enjoy the rest of your day but not in a bliss of ignorance, madam.”
