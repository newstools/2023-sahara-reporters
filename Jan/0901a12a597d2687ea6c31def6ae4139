Islamic Police, Hisbah Arrests Herbalist For Impregnating Customer In Kano Officials of the Islamic police, Hisbah in Dawakin Kudu Local Government Area of Kano have arrested a herbalist, Muhammad Mansur, for impregnating a woman, who went to him to seek medication.  Mansur who hails from Kode town in Kano State, Northwest Nigeria, was arrested after the victim (name withheld) reported him to the Hisbah office to seek justice regarding the seven-month-old pregnancy she has, which she claimed belonged to him.  According to Daily Trust, the randy herbalist is known for deceiving women, including married ones, telling them if he slept with them, he would give them charms that would prevent their husbands from marrying more wives and having control over them.  The victim said the man had been trying to sleep with her since her mother went with her to seek medication, but he didn’t succeed until she went there alone.  “When I accompanied my mother to his place, he told her that she should be coming along with me. One day I went there alone and he said he must sleep with me before he will assist with the medication I needed,” the woman said.  “In fact, he said it wouldn’t work if we didn’t do so. That is what happened. I want the Hisbah to help me. I have a seven-month pregnancy, and he is trying to reject it.”  On his part, Mansur confessed to impregnating the lady, adding that it was the work of the devil.  “She came to my place for medication, but you know the devil is everywhere if you are not careful. I accept my offence and I want the Hisbah to please forgive me,” he said.
