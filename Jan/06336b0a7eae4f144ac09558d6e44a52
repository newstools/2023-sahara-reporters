Participants at the civil society South-East stakeholdersâ€™ meeting on the 2023 general elections in Enugu State have expressed disappointment over the activities of some officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) whom they accused of failing in the discharge of their duties.  Speaking at the Forum, the participants alleged that at various Permanent Voter Cards distribution centres across the South east region, many eligible voters could not obtain their cards despite several visits to the centers. They however called on the management of the electoral body in the region, to use the one-week extension for the distribution exercise to ensure that no voter was disenfranchised. INEC was however commended for ensuring the compliance with the schedules on the electoral processes so far, urging the Commission to ensure that all votes count at the 2023 polls in the country. Heads of the security agencies in the South East who participated at the stakeholders meeting assured their readiness to provide effective security before, during and after the elections. Meanwhile, SaharaReporters' checks showed that INEC officials were not distributing the PVCs at local communities. It was observed that in Obeagu community in Ishielu Ward 8, in Ebonyi State, INEC officials were not distributing the PVCs. A resident of the community, Ogbuabor Samuel, told SaharaReporters that since the PVCs distribution exercise began, no INEC staff had shown face in the Ward.
