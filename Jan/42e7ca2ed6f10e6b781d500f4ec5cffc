There has been tension along the Zaria-Kano highway in Kaduna State as protesting tanker drivers blocked the road following the alleged killing of their colleague by Nigerian Army personnel. SaharaReporters learnt that since the incident happened on Wednesday, the protesting drivers had blocked the highway and caused gridlock on the busy road for days without any intervention from the authorities. It was gathered that the incident occurred near Tashar Yari in Makarfi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. On Saturday, a witness told SaharaReporters that the drivers were finding it difficult to load passengers to Kano from Abuja and Kaduna State. He said, “The Zaria-Kano Road has been blocked by tanker drivers for the past four days now. I left Abuja on Friday for Kaduna and this morning to Kano, else it would be very challenging. We had to go through some Katsina villages through Zaria to link up Kano from a different axis.” “For four days now and the government is yet to act. Drivers are finding it difficult loading passengers to Kano from Abuja/Kaduna,” he added. Confirming the blockage of the road by the protesting drivers and the killing of the driver, acting Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission, Lawal Garba said other security agencies had been contacted to help resolve the situation to open the highway for stranded motorists. “The blockage of the road started after a soldier attached to the construction company working on the road was alleged to have shot a tanker driver following a misunderstanding. The tanker drivers then blocked the road completely in protest. “I have contacted Director of DSS, Police Commissioner and the NURTW. I also informed the State Director Internal Security of the situation. We are working to resolve the situation,” he said.
