The local debt amounts to N89. 89 billion while the foreign debt amounts to $123.02 million. The Enugu State governorship candidate of the People's Redemption Party (PRP), Comrade Chris Agu, has condemned the accumulation of foreign and local debts by the state government. The local debt amounts to N89. 89 billion while the foreign debt amounts to $123.02 million. According to Agu, generations of Enugu people yet unborn would not be able to complete repayment of the loans in the next 100 years.  Agu, who spoke with journalists in Enugu, decried that every indigene of Enugu State would pay N35.956 million each for the local debt alone to be repaid if the money is divided among 2.5 million people.  He accused Ugwuanyi of borrowing such loans without utilising the funds for development, adding that most of the roads or infrastructure in the state, including roads which were budgeted for, were not executed. He also lamented that primary school teachers are not paid the N30,000 new minimum wage while retired civil servants are owed gratuities and other entitlements.  Enugu State is the seventh most indebted state in the country, with Abia, Enugu and Ebonyi states leading in the Southeast geopolitical zone among the 28 states that have piled up over N5.8 trillion in debt for their successors.  Lagos State is leading all the other states with N877.04 billion domestic debt and $1.27 billion foreign debt, followed by Kaduna, with a domestic debt of N86.86bn and external debt of $586.78 million.  The record of debts against states both for domestic and external debts was published by Debts Management Office (DMO) on its website on September 30 and June 30, 2022, respectively.  The third highest debtor is Rivers, with a domestic debt of N225.51 billion and foreign debt of $140.18 million, followed by Cross River State, with N175.2bn domestic debt and $215.75m external debt.  Ogun is the fifth indebted state with N241.78 billion domestic debt and $122.73 million foreign debt; followed by Bauchi with N144.28 billion domestic debt and $172.76 million external debt. Enugu comes next with N89.89b billion domestic debt and $123.02 million foreign debt. This is followed by Kano with N125.19 billion local debt and $109.42 million foreign debt while Abia takes the ninth position with N104.57 billion local debt and $95.63 million foreign debt. Adamawa takes the 10th position with N122.48 billion local debt and $77.01 million foreign debt.  However, commenting on the huge debts, Agu accused the PDP administration in the state of borrowing money recklessly from both foreign and local sources without using same for projects that would create employment for the youths or yield income for the state.  "I am sure that the PRP government in Enugu State, will not borrow fresh loans. The PRP government in Enugu State will create jobs for the youth and establish industries for the people," he said.
