The reverred cleric made the claim on Saturday morning, January 7, during this month's Holy Ghost Service, dubbed "Wonderful," held at Redemption City on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in Ogun State. Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, has said that God has not revealed to him the winner of the forthcoming Nigeria’s presidential election in February. The reverred cleric made the claim on Saturday morning, January 7, during this month's Holy Ghost Service, dubbed "Wonderful," held at Redemption City on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in Ogun State. He therefore urged RCCG members and Nigerians in general to keep their Permanent Voter Cards handy and ready to be used to exercise their civic rights come the February 25 presidential election, whether God determined the winner before then or not. “You may be saying the election is next month and He has not spoken until now. I advise that you get your PVCs ready. “If He doesn’t speak before the elections, then be ready to vote as your spirit leads. If He tells me, well, I may tell you or I may not,” he said. Speaking to the congregation about other prophecies that may have been heard about the winner, Adeboye stressed the importance of listening only to God's words and rejecting false prophecies. The RCCG leader also charged the congregation to live holy in order to hear when God speaks and to be ready to follow His instructions in order to avoid being led astray by false prophecies.
