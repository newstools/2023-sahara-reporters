Reuters reports that the activist's lawyer who disclosed the information about her sentence did not give details of the charges against Faezeh Hashemi. Faezeh Hashemi, activist and daughter of a former Iranian President has been sentenced to five years in prison. Reuters reports that the activist's lawyer who disclosed the information about her sentence did not give details of the charges against Faezeh Hashemi. However, Reuters noted that the semi-official ISNA news agency said that Tehran's public prosecutor indicted Hashemi in 2022 on charges of "propaganda against the system." Indian state media in September reported that Hashemi had been arrested for "inciting riots" in Tehran during protests triggered by the death of a young Kurdish woman in police custody. The demonstrations had reportedly posed one of the biggest challenges to Iran's clerical rulers since the 1979 revolution. Reuters quoted defence lawyer, Neda Shams, as saying, "Following the arrest of Ms. Faezeh Hashemi, she was sentenced to five years in prison but the sentence is not final." In 2012, Faezeh Hashemi was reportedly sentenced to jail and banned from political activities for “anti-state propaganda” dating back to the 2009 disputed presidential election.
