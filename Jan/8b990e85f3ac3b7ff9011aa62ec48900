NSCDC spokesman, Olusola Odumosu said that seven of its operatives and five others were ambushed and killed at the Kuriga mining site. The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has confirmed that terrorists stormed two communities in the Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed scores of security personnel including seven of its personnel. NSCDC spokesman, Olusola Odumosu said that seven of its operatives and five others were ambushed and killed at the Kuriga mining site. He disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja that the five others were from a sister security agency and local vigilance group. According to residents, the bandits had sealed an agreement with farmers in the area as a pre-condition to allow the locals access their farms. However, the bandits usually passed through the villages to sell rustled cows which the security men stationed at the area were not happy about. Trouble however started when security operatives allegedly killed a boy who normally looked after cattle belonging to the bandits. Angered by the incident, the terrorists in large numbers on Monday stormed check-points along Birnin-Gwari to Kakangi/Randagi road of the Western part of Birnin-Gwari LGA and sniffed life out of some security operatives. Meanwhile, the NSCDC lost three other operatives from the national headquarters in a car crash on Monday evening. The victims included one female and two male operatives.
