The state health commissioner, Dr Aminu Tsanyawa, who confirmed the incident, said the state emergency preparedness committee was evaluating the casualty figures and reviewing the data and measures to address the situation. The Kano State Northwest of Nigeria has confirmed the death of 25 people including children from an outbreak of the deadly Diphtheria disease.  The state health commissioner, Dr Aminu Tsanyawa, who confirmed the incident, said the state emergency preparedness committee was evaluating the casualty figures and reviewing the data and measures to address the situation.  According to Tsanyawa, the rapid response team has been reactivated and indexed an action plan to check the spread of the deadly disease in the state, a report by iBrandTV said.  ‘’Right now, we have presented a budget for this to the government and it has been approved,’’ the medium quoted the commissioner as saying.  He said the low routine immunisation attributed to the spread of the disease is due to the hard-to-be-reached areas in the state.  He, however, noted that the state is strengthening its routine immunisation.  Tsanyawa said apart from the Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital designated as an isolation centre, other isolation centres would be created to check the spread of disease.  “Although we used Yargaya for COVID-19 isolation, we have set the place aside for the isolation of diphtheria infection also.  “We also have three cases of Lassa fever in the state now with the index case from Taraba.  “The people should not panic but if they notice any unusual fever, should immediately visit the hospital.  “We are already embarking on sensitisation to educate the populace on the disease,” Tsanyawa said.  Symptoms of the killer disease may include sore throat, cough, drooling of saliva, change of voice, neck swelling, abnormal breathing, fever or mouth odour.
