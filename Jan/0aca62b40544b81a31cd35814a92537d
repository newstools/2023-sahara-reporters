He further stated that Obi would have to organise “his home front” to convince other regions that Nigeria would be safe in the hands of an Igbo man.  A Nigerian singer, Olawale Brymo, who said that the Igbo presidency will remain a pipe dream as long as there is talk of Biafra in the South-East, has apologised over his tweets.
SaharaReporters had reported that Brymo, a supporter of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, had stated via his official Twitter handle that it was not wise to elect the former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, as President. He further stated that Obi would have to organise “his home front” to convince other regions that Nigeria would be safe in the hands of an Igbo man. However, his apology came after thousands of Nigerians signed a petition to stop him from winning the All Africa Music Award where he was nominated in the “Songwriter of the Year” category. He had been under fire since his statement. Brymo went live on his Instagram account on Friday night to address the issue and clarify what led to his tweets. According to him, the issue started after he shared his opinion about author Chimamanda Adichie refusing national honours but accepting a chieftaincy title in her hometown, Anambra State. He said, “It is very important you understand that this entire fracas began with me seeing in the media that Chimamanda Adichie refused some national honours and had picked up some traditional title in the East at home. “And I suggested that for me, it says a lot about the Igbo presidency because that actual seat is what the region should be eyeing right now. I have clamoured for Igbo presidency in the last few years, you wouldn’t believe it. “It will pop in your mind when you hear the news that Igbos do not actually want the presidency. “I did not insult the tribe, I am sorry to anyone who it sounded as such to. I was trying to weigh into a very important matter.”
