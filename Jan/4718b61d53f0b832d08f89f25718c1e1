SaharaReporters had exclusively reported how the policemen on a stop-and-search duty last Saturday intercepted Arowolo’s new tricycle while he was going home with his girlfriend. Felicia Akinbami, the foster mother of Paul Arowolo, a tricycle rider killed by three yet-to-be-identified policemen attached to Surulere Area C Command in Lagos State is dead. SaharaReporters had exclusively reported how the policemen on a stop-and-search duty last Saturday intercepted Arowolo’s new tricycle while he was going home with his girlfriend. The officers were said to have requested a bribe from the deceased but he refused to part with any money. It was learnt that this angered the policemen who made moves to hijack the tricycle from him. SaharaReporters gathered that in the battle, Arowolo and his girlfriend were assaulted and brutalised. Arowolo later passed out and eventually died. The shock of his death killed his grandmother who raised him, a relation told SaharaReporters on Sunday. “My mother is dead, they have killed my mother, she died yesterday night (last night) over Paul’s death. They have not released his body, they have done an autopsy and realised it was those officers that killed him. Now, this has led to my mother’s death. It was overthinking, it was the shock that killed her, her BP was very high,” one of Arowolo’s aunts told SaharaReporters. Another source added, “There's a lot of sadness here, The grandma that raised the guy has died. “She has not been eating and she has been thinking. She eventually died last night after she heard about the report of the autopsy, which indicates that the late Paul was strangled and was hit multiple times till he gave up the ghost. “She couldn't eat or drink since the day Paul was murdered. She was fed with little food. When it got to a certain point, she vomited, and couldn't take anything in. She eventually passed on last night.”
