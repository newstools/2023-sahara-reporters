A spokesperson for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign council, Dino Melaye, who represented Kogi West Senatorial District in the 8th National Assembly, disclosed this in a video posted on his Twitter handle. The Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) has called on the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to subject the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, to a narcotics test. A spokesperson for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign council, Dino Melaye, who represented Kogi West Senatorial District in the 8th National Assembly, disclosed this in a video posted on his Twitter handle. He also called on the NDLEA to search all the houses owned by Tinubu. “I am making a clarion call on General Buba Marwa, the Chairman of the NDLEA, to please, in the interest of this country, search the residence of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to search for cannabis, cocaine, and other narcotic drugs,” Melaye said. “Please, conduct a narcotic test on Bola Ahmed Tinubu, because for you to be president of this country, you must be drug-free, you must be mentally and physically fit. “Bola Ahmed is not physically fit; he is not mentally fit. It will be dangerous for Nigerians to have a Pablo Escobar as president.” In 2022, the NDLEA wrote to APC, urging the party to include a drugs test as part of its screening of aspirants on their platforms. However, the Nigerian constitution and electoral law does not yet require a drugs test for candidates and parties.
