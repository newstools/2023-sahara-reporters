SaharaReporters had reported that operatives of the Kogi State Command of the Nigeria Police Force on Thursday intercepted workers of Chinese construction firm, CCECC, allegedly engaged by Governor Yahaya Bello-led State government to cut off roads leading to Kogi Central Senatorial District.
The plot, it was learnt, was to prevent the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agents and other stakeholders from accessing the senatorial district during the Saturday presidential and National Assembly elections.
In an update, SaharaReporters gathered that more community roads in the state were excavated including Ege road, Obangede road and Old Ihima-Lagos (Ikare) road. 
It was learnt that the CCECC Loadbed and Excavator with company equipment number tag were used by the construction firm for the Ege-Ihima road excavation.
Unfortunately, an accident has been recorded on one of the roads as the driver did not know the road had been destroyed and he ran inside it.
Meanwhile, till the time of filing this report, the Kogi State government denied hiring the Chinese construction firm for the excavation of the roads nor made any official statement on the destruction of the state and federal roads.
