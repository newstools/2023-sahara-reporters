The Director, Media and Publicity of the All Progressives Congress Tinubu/Shettima Campaign, Bayo Onanuga, disclosed this on Monday via his official Twitter handle. A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has been freed by the Department of State Services (DSS) after grilling him for six hours over his claim that certain politicians are collaborating with the military high command in preparation for a possible coup. The Director, Media and Publicity of the All Progressives Congress Tinubu/Shettima Campaign, Bayo Onanuga, disclosed this on Monday via his official Twitter handle. “Femi Fani-Kayode released by DSS after about six hours of interrogation,” he wrote. Fani-Kayode an All Progressives Congress (APC) chief, was earlier summoned by the DSS for questioning, according to Dr. Peter Afunanya, the DSS's Public Relations Officer. Afunanya had said: “Chief Femi Fani-Kayode has been with the DSS since 9am today 13/02/23 in response to the invitation extended to him by the Service.” This is not the first time Fani-Kayode would be alleged of corruption. In January 2022, The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) re-arraigned him on an amended 17-count charge of money laundering. Fani-Kayode was charged alongside a former Minister of State for Finance, Nenandi Usman, before a Federal High Court in Lagos State.
