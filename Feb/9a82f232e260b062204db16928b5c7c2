The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom has said that the naira swap policy will sink President Muhammadu Buhari’s image if his government fails to review it in due time.  The governor who stated this on Wednesday via a tweet urged the Buhari government to urgently review the policy to ease the hardship it has caused Nigerians.  He said, “Yet, some people are not telling Mr President the truth. Someone close to the President should tell him that this policy will sink his image forever, if he allows it to remain the way it is. The Federal Government should review the policy before the situation gets out of hand.”  The Central Bank of Nigeria had fixed February 10 as the new deadline for the exchange of old naira notes for newly redesigned ones after shifting the deadline from January 31 initially fixed as the deadline.  Many Nigerians are currently unable to obtain the new N200, N500, and N1,000 notes, due to scarcity. This has caused hardship for many Nigerians and businesses. There have also been violent protests in some cities.  For instance, SaharaReporters earlier reported how angry youths in Warri town, Delta State burnt one of the branches of Access Bank while protesting against the persisting scarcity of naira notes that has forced many businesses across the country to shut down.  On Wednesday, some banks were also vandalised in Benin City, the capital of Edo State, South-South Nigeria.
