‘Maputo protocol’ was an African legal instrument that protects the lives of women.  A non-profit organisation (BAOBAB) for Women's Human Rights, has called for the protection and promotion of the rights of women and girls across Nigeria and Africa for rapid development on the continent. The group’s Director of Programmes, Mrs Anne Adidu-Lawal, disclosed this at a press briefing in Lagos on Friday. The group urged the implementation of “Maputo protocol”, an international human rights instrument established by the African Union and that took effect in 2005. According to Adidu-Lawal, the ‘Maputo protocol’ was an African legal instrument that protects the lives of women. Speaking further, she said that the instrument looked at culture, religion and practice peculiar to Africans to build the capacity of women. Adidu-Lawal disclosed that the inauguration of the Lagos outreach of the group became necessary in order to give women a stronger voice in the country. Also speaking during the event, Communications and Outreach Coordinator of the group, Ene Oshaba, said that BAOBAB had volunteers interested in promoting the rights of women and girls. She said, “We want to see a different society, understand women's issues and be committed to the rights of women. “We respect human rights and want a space where women can express themselves freely and not take ownership and head of the family.” Lagos Outreach Coordinator of the group, Dr Olawunni Oni-Buraimoh, in her own remarks said that the story of BAOBAB was all about resilience, ruggedness, motivation and achievements among others. “Integrity keeps the group going and we would not deviate from this path. “Once women are ready to learn, there is opportunity for capacity building as the organisation helps females at all levels.”
