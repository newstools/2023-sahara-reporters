Recall that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Spokesman, Emma Powerful, alleged a plot to assassinate Atiku in the South-East region. Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, has dismissed a purported assassination threat against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar on Monday. Recall that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Spokesman, Emma Powerful, alleged a plot to assassinate Atiku in the South-East region. But reacting to the claim via a statement by the National President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, Okwu Nnabuike, the group urged Atiku to ignore the alleged threat. According to the statement, there is nothing to warrant the killing of Atiku or anyone else in the region, stressing that all presidential candidates are free to come to the region and present their blueprints to the masses. He said, “We received with concern the statement credited to IPOB, wherein it alleged that there is a plot to assassinate the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku, in the South-East. “We want to make it clear that no such plot exists anywhere in Igbo land. Ndigbo are known for their hospitality, and this has not changed. “Atiku has an Igbo man, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, as a running mate for the election. He’s also an in-law to Ndigbo and should, therefore, feel free to come to the South East for his campaign any day any time.” Okwu cautioned against any action or statement that could create unnecessary tension in the region.
