The police vowed to prosecute anyone engaging in breach of public peace during and after the forthcoming general elections. The police in Lagos, Southwest Nigeria, have declared one Tajudeen Olanrewaju Bakre, President of the Supreme Body of Ogboni Association Worldwide, wanted for allegedly threatening public peace with a pump-action. Ogboni is a fraternal organisation that is found in Southwest Nigeria, Edo in South-South Nigeria, Benin Republic and Togo. The police vowed to prosecute anyone engaging in breach of public peace during and after the forthcoming general elections. The command in a statement issued on Thursday by its spokesman, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, solicited useful information from Nigerians that will lead to his arrest, promising that such information would be highly appreciated and treated with the utmost confidentiality. Hundeyin stated that the command, following the emergence of a video earlier in the week showing a man wielding a pump-action rifle and threatening public peace, raided the residence of the man who was identified as Tajudeen Olanrewaju Bakre in the Surulere area of the state. According to him, the sting operation was led by CSP Egbeyemi, the commander Rapid Response Squad (RRS), working on actionable intelligence. Hundeyin said following the raid, "the team found in the suspect’s residence three pump action rifles, one Beretta pistol magazine, one expended and three live cartridges and a picture frame of the suspect”. "The suspect, Tajudeen Olanrewaju Bakare, narrowly escaped arrest and is hereby declared wanted," the statement posted on his Twitter handle reads. "Any useful information leading to his arrest would be highly appreciated and treated with utmost confidentiality." The police command commended Lagos residents for their vigilance and prompt information to security agencies. They warned all troublemakers to steer clear of the state, insisting that anyone found wanting would be treated in accordance with the law.
