An Islamic group under the umbrella of Jam’iyyatu Ansaariddeen Attijjaniyya (JAMAA) has demanded justice for Nigeria adherents of Tijjaniyya who were reportedly killed by Burkinabe Army in Burkina Faso on their way to visit the Tijjaniyya worldwide leader. The National Secretary of JAMAA, Sayyidi Muhammad AlQasim Yahaya, while addressing journalists in Abuja, said the adherents of Tijjaniyya worldwide are known to regularly pay visits to the home country of their leader, Sheikhul-Islam Alhaji Ibrahim Niasse Al-Kaulahee, particularly for conferences and Maulid celebrations, according to Daily Trust. Yahaya said, “During such movements, convoys of vehicles from Nigeria used to travel through international borders to Kaolack, Senegal, traversing countries such as Niger, Burkina-Faso, and Mali.” The JAMAA national secretary said that during the 2023 journey, a delegation of Nigerians in a convoy of luxurious and mini-buses was stopped by the Burkinabe Army on patrol and made to disembark from their buses. He narrated that they were “randomly selected without any questioning and cold-bloodedly shot to death in a most horrendous display of bestiality”. He continued, “The current number of casualties is 16 dead, while some vehicles and their occupants are yet to be accounted for. “Deriving from the above, we hearken to urgently draw the attention of the Nigerian Government, the United Nations, and genuine human rights organisations to, as a matter of responsibility, wade into this matter and ensure that the rights of the victims of this massacre are upheld and the blood-thirsty culprits are immediately brought to book. “All members and fellow Muslims are called upon to pray for the repose of the souls of the innocent victims.”
