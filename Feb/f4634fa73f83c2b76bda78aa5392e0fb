Buhari described the APC candidate, notorious for several public blunders, as a “committed Nigerian and I believe he will give all he has to this country and to you Nigerians.” President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that he knows Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress for more than 26 years and he would not stop campaigning for him. Buhari described the APC candidate, notorious for several public blunders, as a “committed Nigerian and I believe he will give all he has to this country and to you Nigerians.” The president spoke at the party’s campaign in Nasarawa State. He said, “I’m very pleased today to be part of this campaign for Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said. “I have known him for more than twenty-six years ago. I will continue to campaign for Bola Tinubu. He is a committed Nigerian and I believe he will give all he has to this country and to you Nigerians.” Buhari’s statement comes amid reports of rancour in the APC, after Tinubu’s outburst during the party’s presidential rally in Ogun State, where he expressed dissatisfaction over the fuel and currency scarcity in the country. “Even if you change the ink on naira notes, what you want will not happen. We will win. That umbrella party will lose. We will take this government from them — saboteurs that are dragging power with us,” said Tinubu in Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun.
