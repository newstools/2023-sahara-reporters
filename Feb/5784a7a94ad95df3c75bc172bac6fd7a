The perpetrators, he believes, deserve the wrath of divine and natural justice. President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned Friday's heinous killing of the Labour Party's (LP) senatorial candidate for Enugu State East Senatorial District, Chief Oyibo Chukwu, and his aide. According to Buhari's spokesman, Femi Adesina, the perpetrators of this heinous act have no regard for human life or dignity. The perpetrators, he believes, deserve the wrath of divine and natural justice. In addition, the President directed security agencies to “track down the culprits of this heinous crime,” even as he sympathized with the families of the victims, the Labour Party and the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA. SaharaReporters had earlier reported that gunmen suspected to be political thugs on Wednesday night shot and killed Elder Chukwu, in what political pundits described as a politically motivated killing. It had been reported that the assailants also killed other occupants of his vehicle and set them ablaze with a Sienna vehicle they were driving. Oyibo Chukwu was the former chairman of Oji-River Branch of the Nigerian Bar Association between 2017 and 2019. SaharaReporters had also reported that the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, had given the Nigeria Police Force and the Enugu State Government 48 hours to fish out the sponsors and killers of former chairman and the Labour Party Senatorial candidate for Enugu East Senatorial district, Elder Oyibo Chukwu. Reacting to his gruesome killing at a press conference, held on Thursday, at Enugu High Court complex, the NBA State Branch described his gruesome murder as unacceptable and suspected that it was politically motivated.
