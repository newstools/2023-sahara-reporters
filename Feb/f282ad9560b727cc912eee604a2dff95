Aiyetan disclosed this on his Twitter page. The Executive Director of the International Center for Investigative Reporting, Dayo Aiyetan was on Saturday molested by hoodlums in Gwagwalada, FCT Abuja while covering the election.  Aiyetan disclosed this on his Twitter page.  The senior journalist said he was beaten while his phone, car key, purse and a pouch containing his debit cards, Nigeria and US driver's licenses and other items were missing.  He added that he has reported the assault to the Divisional Police Officer of Gwagwalada area.  “I was attacked this morning in Gwagwalada while covering the election. There was disturbance and a guy was trying to upturn the canopy on top of INEC officials. I was recording the scene when a guy told me to stop recording. I did. In seconds, I was surrounded by hordes of people.  “Miscreant, thugs etc. I was beaten, my clothes turn and my phone, car key, purse and a pouch containing my debit cards, Nigeria and US driver's licenses and other items. They took everything on me. But I fought to keep my camera.  “A guy brought out a knife and tried to stab me. I kicked him with my steel toed Skechers and ... Fortunately, apart from a few scratches, I escaped unhurt.  “There was a policewoman at the PU and I was just praying that she wouldn't try to intervene cos they would have beaten her too. Place was Agwan Fulani Town Hall. Kudos to CSP Hamza Sadiq, DPO Gwagwalada, a committed, passionate officer, who has recovered my phone for me. I also have my car key. But my voter's card, driver's licenses, debit cards etc and purse are still missing.  “It is obvious that the Nigerian police does not have the men to cover the elections. They will try their best but they don't have the manpower, no matter what the police chiefs say.”
