He was confronted by angry youths who barricaded the road and drove him and his campaign team away.   Aggrieved youths of Adonte, an agrarian community in the Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta state have chased away the minority leader of the house of representatives and member representing Aniocha and Oshimili federal constituency in the lower chamber, Ndudi Elumelu from their community. SaharaReporters gathered that trouble started when the federal lawmaker and his campaign team on Friday went to the community for a rally. However, he was confronted by angry youths who barricaded the road and drove him and his campaign team away. One of the visibly angry youths who simply identified himself as Amaechi, told SaharaReporters that their grievances against the federal lawmaker stemmed from his failure to deliver the dividends of democracy for over 20 years that they have been voting for him. "Ndudi Elumelu is a big monumental failure, he's greedy and selfish. He's seeking a fourth term without any visible dividends of democracy to show for it in our community. No road, no water, no light, no amenities in the localities in the 24 years of PDP government in Delta state. This time around, it is not going to be business as usual. Elumelu must not step into our community to campaign. "He has failed woefully and does not deserve our vote. He has been tested and cannot be trusted at all at all. Enough is enough, Elumelu has deceived us enough and we are wiser now. We chased him and his campaign team away, we blocked our road with woods; he cannot enter our community,‚Äù the youth said.
