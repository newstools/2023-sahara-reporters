Desperate politicians who are afraid of losing the forthcoming elections following the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) have now unleashed terror on opponents to scare voters away from coming out on election day so that their friends will vote them in, a source had told SaharaReporters.  Efforts to speak with the spokesperson for the state police command, DSP Daniel Ndukwe, were unsuccessful as he could not be reached by telephone at the time of filing this report.
