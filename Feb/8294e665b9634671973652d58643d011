Umar was apprehended by the police while on his way to deliver the ammunition to a man in Jada town, in the Jada Local Government Area ahead of the commencement of the presidential and National Assembly elections. The Nigeria Police Force on election day confirmed arresting 18-year-old Abubakar Umar, for illegal possession of 33 rounds of AK-47 live ammunition in Adamawa state.  Umar was apprehended by the police while on his way to deliver the ammunition to a man in Jada town, in the Jada Local Government Area ahead of the commencement of the presidential and National Assembly elections.  Jada is the hometown of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar.  The teenager, who resides in Jada, has since confessed to the crime. He identified one Musa as the man who sent him to deliver the weapons.  SaharaReporters gathered that Umar was paid N5,000 by a man simply identified as Musa, and sent to deliver the ammunition to a man whose identity has yet to be disclosed.  He was also equipped with a charm that is said to be able to make him vanish in case he meets with the police or other security agencies on his way.  Unfortunately, he was nabbed by the police on routine patrol.  While confirming the arrest, the spokesperson for the state police command, SP Suleiman Nguroje, said, "The suspects will be investigated and charged to court for prosecution."
