The report was published and shared on Twitter by Premium Times.  A news report wherein Seun Anikulapo-Kuti, Nigerian musician and son of the late afro-beat legend, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti described Labour Party Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi as “an opportunist who cannot rescue Nigeria” has been liked on Twitter by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The report was published and shared on Twitter by Premium Times. However, INEC official handle was one of the 324 Twitter users who had liked the post, which called to question the anonymity and neutrality of the commission in its conduct of the February 25 presidential election and overall general elections. Seun had in the report which was from an interview with the online platform, Mic On podcast, hosted by Channels TV’s Seun Okinbaloye argued that no politician could save Nigeria except for Nigerians themselves. The podcast also had Japhet Omojuwa and Sijibomi Ogundele as guests. The singer further described the Labour Party’s presidential candidate as the internet’s favourite who he claimed might not rescue Nigeria from its current challenges even if he won the election. He also referred to Obi as “an opportunist who started a movement” after losing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primaries. “He hasn’t had the time because he started too late. You can’t be telling me that just because you lost PDP primaries 18 months before the election, you suddenly started a movement, and you have a plan for the country,” he had said. “No, that’s opportunism. And it’s not an opportunist that will deliver Nigeria—not jumping on Labour Party. The Labour Party has a socialist structure. Peter Obi is a capitalist. Where are they going?”
