This was stated in a public notice distributed to journalists by Jigawa State Commissioner for Special Duties Auwal Sankara. The Jigawa State Government has promised to recognise the Supreme Court's order prohibiting the Federal Government from removing the old naira notes from circulation as legal tender. This was stated in a public notice distributed to journalists by Jigawa State Commissioner for Special Duties Auwal Sankara. The Central Bank of Nigeria had fixed February 10 as the new deadline for the exchange of old naira notes for newly redesigned ones after shifting the deadline from January 31 initially fixed as the deadline. Many Nigerians are currently unable to obtain the new N200, N500, and N1,000 notes, due to scarcity. This has caused hardship for many Nigerians and businesses. There have also been violent protests in some cities.  To ease the situation, President Buhari ordered the Central Bank Governor to allow the old N200 notes to circulate till April 10, 2023, when it would cease to be legal tender.  However, according to the public notice issued by the Jigawa government, commercial banks, corporate organisations, ministries, agencies, and traders must accept the old notes or face sanctions from the state government.  The statement reads: “It has come to its notice some individuals and corporate bodies are rejecting the now-old N200, N500, and N1,000 notes. The Jigawa State Government is concerned about the conduct of such individuals.  “Jigawa State Government respects the rights of its people and those rejecting the now-old currencies are enjoined to desist from disobeying the law and causing hardships to the people of Jigawa State.”  “Jigawa State Government will not hesitate to use section 287(1) of the Constitution (as amended) and other extant laws to enforce the order of the Supreme Court of Nigeria,” the statement added.
