Igbokwe filed the suit numbered ABJ/CS/138/2022 at the Federal High Court, Abuja. But it was transferred to the Federal High Court in Umuahia, presided over by Justice E. N. Anyadike. A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Abia state, Mayor Lucky Igbokwe, better known as Don Lulu, has sued the party over its governorship primary election which returned Chief Okey Ahiwe as its candidate in the forthcoming March 11, 2023 election.  Igbokwe filed the suit numbered ABJ/CS/138/2022 at the Federal High Court, Abuja. But it was transferred to the Federal High Court in Umuahia, presided over by Justice E. N. Anyadike. The suit is seeking the nullification of the second primary election and the candidacy of Ahiwe.  The PDP in Abia State had conducted its governorship primary on 25 May, 2022 which produced the late Prof. Uche Ikonne.  In that election, Igbokwe was the first runner-up, coming behind Ikonne.  However, the PDP candidate died before the conduct of the general election.  But Igbokwe noted that instead of elevating him, the first runner-up, to become the party's candidate, the PDP national body and the Independent National Electoral Commission called for a fresh governorship primary election from which Ahaiwe emerged as the new candidate of the party.  In the amended originating summons filed by Dr J. A. Akubo, SAN, the plaintiff claims among others, a declaratory relief that he is the authentic candidate of the PDP for Abia State governorship election.  He also sought the court's declaratory order that Ahiwe was not qualified to contest the fresh primary election having not participated in the previous primary election hence his election should be nullified.  Meanwhile, the case has been fixed for hearing on Thursday.
