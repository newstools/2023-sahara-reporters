BBC reports that Putin in his speech is likely to depict the war as a struggle against the West as he tries to shore up support at home. The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, in his State of the Nation address on Tuesday is set to speak about the one-year Russia-Ukraine war, as President Joe Biden of the United States of America and the Italian Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, visit Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. BBC reports that Putin in his speech is likely to depict the war as a struggle against the West as he tries to shore up support at home. The speech which the Russian President postponed in December 2022, comes ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Friday 2022. The country has sustained huge losses in Ukraine but is expected to launch a new offensive in the Spring. Meanwhile, Putinâ€™s speech is coming at the time when the US President, Biden and the Italian PM, Meloni are on a visit to Kyiv, Ukraine capital. Biden, who is expected to give a speech in Poland later today, visited Kyiv on Monday where he said that the Russia-Ukraine war is a struggle between democracy and autocracy, while President Zelensky said he could see resolve from the US to end Russian aggression this year. BBC further reports that there have been rumours that Italy might be ready to send Ukraine fighter jets, although any decision of this sort will have to be coordinated with the rest of the EU. The Italian PM, Meloni will also likely want to reassure President Zelensky that Italy stands by Ukraine against Russia's invasion despite recent controversial declarations by the leaders of two parties in her government coalition.
