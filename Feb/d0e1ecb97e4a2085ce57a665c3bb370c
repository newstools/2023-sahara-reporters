The party said the current cash crunch and its effect on the populace, fuel scarcity and hike in the pump price of petrol compelled it to take the decision. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has reportedly suspended its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu’s campaign rally in Oyo State indefinitely over fuel and Naira notes scarcity. APC had scheduled Tinubu’s campaign rally for Tuesday in Ibadan, the state capital but on Monday, the Oyo State Publicity Secretary of the party, Olawale Sadare, said that the decision to postpone the rally indefinitely was taken by the Governor Simon Lalong-led Presidential Campaign Council. Sadare said, “We need to allow President Muhammadu Buhari to work around the situation and ensure that normalcy returns, particularly as it concerns fuel and currency notes crises. “At Oyo APC, we were convinced that it was necessary not to go ahead with the event in order not to play into the hands of some anti-democratic forces who do not want the general elections to hold.” The party said the current cash crunch and its effect on the populace, fuel scarcity and hike in the pump price of petrol compelled it to take the decision. Sadare added, “We regret to announce the indefinite postponement of our presidential rally earlier slated for Tuesday. The decision was taken in consideration of the prevailing challenges facing the nation.” According to him, a new date for the rally would be announced in due course, while assuring that the APC would host its presidential candidate, Tinubu, in no distant future, while he appealed for calm among its loyalists and assured that the party would be victorious at the forthcoming general elections.
