Daily Trust reports that the meeting held in Abuja and that their discussions centred around defection. There is uncertainty in the Labour Party camp as its Kano State Chairman, Bashir Ishaq Bashir, governorship candidate and his running mate, on Sunday evening met with the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.  Daily Trust reports that the meeting held in Abuja and that their discussions centred around defection.  Meanwhile, Bashir has neither officially announced his defection from LP nor stated whether he would abandon his governoship ambition or not. Therefore, the outcome of the meeting is not yet known. The meeting comes barely two weeks after the governorship candidate in the state led other party leaders to boycott the Labour Party rally of the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Members of the party who boycotted Obi’s rally included LP Presidential Campaign Council Director in Kano, Mohammed Zarewa; state coordinator of Peter Obi’s campaign, Balarabe Wakili and a member of the presidential campaign council, Idris Dambazau.
