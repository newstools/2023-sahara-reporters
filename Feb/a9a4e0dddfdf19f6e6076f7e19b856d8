SaharaReporters learnt that Lawson was arrested by the police, after a native doctor claimed that her face appeared in his shrine as a suspect who stole her (Lawson) friend’s missing gold. Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State command from Elepe Ladegboye, Ikorodu, on Monday arrested and detained a woman identified as Omotolani Lawson, over a baseless charge. SaharaReporters learnt that Lawson was arrested by the police, after a native doctor claimed that her face appeared in his shrine as a suspect who stole her (Lawson) friend’s missing gold. Lawson’s family source told SaharaReporters that Lawson visited her friend whose identity could not be ascertained, two weeks prior to the day the gold, said to be worth over N3million, went missing. The family source said that “the woman whose gold was stolen went to the herbalist’s house and complained that she was looking for her gold. Maybe she submitted some people’s names but the herbalist said he saw Omotolani’s face as the person that stole the gold. “When they said they saw her face in the shrine there, they went to the police station and the police went to her house and arrested her on the ground that they saw her face in the shrine that she was the one that stole the gold and the woman that her gold was stolen is well connected.” The family source said that Lawson had been in the police station since Monday morning when she was arrested. The police have also reportedly said she would be charged to court on Tuesday on the basis that her face was seen in the native doctor’s shrine as the person who stole the missing gold. When SaharaReporters called the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, on the phone for comments on the matter, he declined the calls and requested for a text message. A text message was sent to him requesting for comments but though the text successfully delivered, he has not responded till the time of filing this report.
