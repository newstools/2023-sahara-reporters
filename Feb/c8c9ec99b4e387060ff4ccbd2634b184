There have been allegations that a cabal in the Presidency does not want Tinubu to succeed Buhari. President Muhammadu Buhari says he openly displayed his ballot paper to show that he voted for the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu and not for another candidate. There have been allegations that a cabal in the Presidency does not want Tinubu to succeed Buhari. However, after voting on Saturday in Daura, his hometown in Katsina State, Northwest Nigeria, Buhari displayed his ballot to show his loyalty and support for his party and its candidate, NAN reports.  Buhari described showing his ballot paper to the media and the public as further proof of his commitment to the party and its national leader, Tinubu, noting that he had also campaigned for him.  “All over the places, I mentioned my favourite candidate, Asiwaju Tinubu, and I believe my constituency will elect him 100 per cent,’’ said Buhari, who cast his vote alongside his wife, Aisha, and other family members at Ward A, Sarkin Yara Polling Unit 003.  However, several Nigerians have faulted the president’s action for contravening electoral laws.  Asked how he felt that it was the first time since 2003 that he was not on the ballot paper, the president said it was exciting.  “I look at those who are competing, and some of them are so agitated, and they didn’t know that I tried three times and ended up in the Supreme Court three times.  “The fourth time I said ‘God dey’, and God sent technology, Permanent Voters Card, so no fraudulent person can claim anything,’’ he stated.
