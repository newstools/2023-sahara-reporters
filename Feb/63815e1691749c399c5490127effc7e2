He is standing trial over the alleged use of false documents, fabricated evidence and procuring execution of documents before an Ikeja Special Offences Court. The forgery trial of a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, before the Lagos State  Special Offences Court in Ikeja was stalled on Monday as the ex-minister was absent from court. He is standing trial over the alleged use of false documents, fabricated evidence and procuring execution of documents before an Ikeja Special Offences Court. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission is prosecuting Fani-Kayode on 12 counts, in which he was accused of tendering forged medical report before Justice Daniel Osiagor of the Federal High Court in Lagos, where he is being prosecuted for alleged N4.9bn fraud. PUNCH reports that at the resumed hearing of the matter on Monday, the defendant’s counsel, Wale Balogun, informed the court that Fani-Kayode was not in court. “We regret to announce to your lordship that the defendant is not in court due to health reasons, and secondly due to a running battle he has with both the DSS and the police.” Balogun informed the court that “since the last time we were here, the defendant has been reporting every day at the DSS, and while he was doing this, the Nigeria Police invited him” for questioning with regards to some comments Fani-Kayode made online. “Since we left here at the last date, he has not been able to have peace of mind, and that has affected his health.”
