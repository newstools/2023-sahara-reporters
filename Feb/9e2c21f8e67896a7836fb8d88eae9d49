According to Nasir El-Rufai, some elements in the Presidency are working hard to ensure the failure of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in this month's presidential elections.  The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has claimed President Muhammadu Buhari is fully supporting All Progressives Congress presidential candidate Bola Tinubu (APC). The minister who was making response to the comments credited to Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna State, described Buhari’s campaign for the APC flag bearer as an indication of his support. According to Nasir El-Rufai, some elements in the Presidency are working hard to ensure the failure of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in this month's presidential elections. He also claimed that the same forces were to blame for the current crisis caused by the petrol subsidy, which caused the country to waste over N6 trillion annually. In response, Mohammed stated that the government was unaware and that the Buhari administration's priority was to ensure credible elections, which many interpreted to mean that the number one citizen did not have Tinubu's support. The minister said it was "preposterous to even suggest that Mr President, who is the leader of our party, is equivocating on his support for our presidential candidate" at the 22nd edition of the administration's scorecard series on Thursday in Abuja, TheCable reports. “Yesterday, while reacting to a question at the post-Federal Executive Council briefing at the State House, I said, inter alia, that Mr President is committed to a free, fair and credible elections,” he said.
