The Kogi State Government has confirmed the detonation of an explosive device suspected to be a bomb at the Local Government secretariat in Okehi Local Government area. SaharaReporters had exclusively reported how some yet-to-be-identified gunmen on Monday evening reportedly blew off the administrative offices of the local government area. It was learnt that the administrative offices are close to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office in the local government area. The State Security Adviser, Duro Jerry Omodara who confirmed the development in Lokoja on Tuesday, said the intention of the saboteurs may be to cause a panic during the general elections to prevent people from coming out to vote. Omoadara said no life was lost, adding that security men had been deployed to the area to see that normalcy was restored. This development is coming about two months after explosives were detonated at the palace of the Ohinoyi of Ebira land during the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari for the commissioning of some legacy projects in the state.
