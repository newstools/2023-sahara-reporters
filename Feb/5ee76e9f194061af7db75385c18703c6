The protesters who gathered at Ward 4, Epie 1, which has 47 units covering Agudama and Akenpai Communities, are insisting that the election will not hold until the missing ballot papers are replaced.
Speaking on the development, Austin Atekere, the Supervisory Presiding Officer, SPO, said when they received the election materials from the INEC headquarters in Yenagoa, they were not sorted out until they got to the ward headquarters, Tribune reports.
Atekere said, “Only to get to our headquarters to realise that all the ballot papers for other elections were complete, except that of the House of Representatives election. The ward has about 50,000 registered voters but we were given just 15,000 ballot papers.
“As I speak with you, people have dragged and almost beaten me up, but the quick intervention of community members saved my life. We have contacted INEC, and they have informed us that the situation is not peculiar to Agudama/Akenpai alone.”
