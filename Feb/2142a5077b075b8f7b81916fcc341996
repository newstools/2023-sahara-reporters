The United States Government has signed an agreement to return $954,000 allegedly stolen by the former Governor of Bayelsa State, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, to the state government through the Federal Government. The agreement was signed on Thursday in Abuja by Mary Leonard, US ambassador to Nigeria, and Beatrice Jedy-Agba, Solicitor-General of the Federation and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice. According to the US ambassador, the official salary of the former governor during his tenure as a public servant from 1999 to his impeachment in 2005 did not match the said amount. “However, during that time, he accumulated millions of dollars through abuse of office, money laundering,” she said. Alamieyeseigha died in October 2015 at the age of 62.
