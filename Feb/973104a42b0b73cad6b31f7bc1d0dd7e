Protest has rocked Bori community in the Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State, southern Nigeria as residents rose against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), alleging that its officials manipulated the results of Saturdayâ€™s presidential and National Assembly elections.  The angry protesters made up of men and women, both old and young, blocked roads and sat on the ground. They alleged that the election umpire rigged the elections, thereby thwarting their will and making their votes not to count.  They alleged that many people were not able to cast their votes while the votes of those who cast their ballots were manipulated.  The protesters therefore demanded that either the elections in the area are cancelled or INEC should count their votes correctly.  https://twitter.com/alakowee/status/1630124350098530304?s=20
