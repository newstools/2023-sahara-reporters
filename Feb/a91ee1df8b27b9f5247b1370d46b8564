She was arrested following an intelligence report received by the commission which led its operatives to seek out and promptly apprehended the suspect. Nigeria's anti-corruption commission, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) says it has arrested a woman identified as Omoseyin Oluwadarasimi Esther offering new naira notes for sale on social media. The anti-corruption commission in a statement issued on Wednesday via its official Twitter handle said the suspect was arrested on Wednesday, February 1, 2023. According to the statement, she was arrested following an intelligence report received by the commission which led its operatives to seek out and promptly apprehended the suspect. "It is believed she is in collusion with key elements in the financial services sector diverting the newly released notes away from banking halls and payment channels into a ‘black market.’ "She is currently in ICPC detention and is helping the Commission with its findings on the criminal trading of the naira and the attendant scarcity and negative economic outcomes being caused by the action," the statement read.
