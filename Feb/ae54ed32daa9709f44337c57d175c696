This was stated by the National Chairman of the commission, Mahmood Yakubu, who lamented the loss of eight Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to political thugs in Delta and Katsina states.  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has admitted a shortage of logistics, security personnel and party agents during Saturday's election. This was stated by the National Chairman of the commission, Mahmood Yakubu, who lamented the loss of eight Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to political thugs in Delta and Katsina states. The INEC boss said the commission is dealing with challenges with logistics, as well as persistent insecurity across the country and complaints from political parties about a lack of polling unit agents in the ongoing presidential and National Assembly elections. INEC Chairman Mahmood Yakubu, speaking at a press conference at the National Collation Centre in Abuja, disclosed that thugs attacked electoral officials in areas such as Safana in Katsina, Shiroro in Niger, and Osimiri in Delta State, resulting in the loss of eight BVAS machines. He did, however, blame political parties for the lapses observed in the shortage of polling unit agents, claiming that the factors contributed to the delay in the commencement of voting in some areas.
