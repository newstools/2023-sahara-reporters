Recall that Jandor was a reporter with the Lagos State Television when Fashola was governor and he was covering the State House and at times handled the camera during the governor’s event. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has bragged that the Lagos State governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olajide Adediran (Jandor), is a “common cameraman” who thinks that following him (Fashola) around when he was the governor gives him (Jandor) the quality to be the governor of the state. Recall that Jandor was a reporter with the Lagos State Television when Fashola was governor and he was covering the State House and at times handled the camera during the governor’s event. Jandor later moved to Abuja with Fashola and later pitched his tent with former Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Tunde Fowler, and became known in politics. PM News reports that speaking at the formal launch of Eko O ni baje 10,000 Foot Soldiers initiated by him, Fashola on Thursday hit back at his former “boy” saying he did not have the quality to be the next governor of Lagos. “Some people say they will take the land from us, that is too much. I did the job of Governor for eight years and part of what helped me was that I was chief of staff to the Governor, even that was not enough. “So just following a Governor being a cameraman (Jandor) and then watching me for eight years, then you think you will now be a governor, you are not ready, come to our leadership school, you are not yet ready. “That is why you will see that they are focusing on the N51billon Lagos State is generating. You did not see the immigrant population that is coming into Lagos every day. The bigger the prosperity, the bigger the problem. Their party don’t see people, they don’t see the problem,” Fashola said. He therefore encouraged members of APC to canvas massively for the party, telling them to vote for the party.
