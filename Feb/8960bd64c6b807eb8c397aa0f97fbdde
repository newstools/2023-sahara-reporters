He stated that his ticket with Baba-Ahmed would ensure a proper place for the youth and urged them to mobilize for the election.  Peter Obi, the Labour Party's (LP) presidential candidate, has urged Nigerians to collect money from any candidate that is ready to offer but cast their vote for him in this month's election. Obi made the request while campaigning in Ilorin, Kwara State's capital, with his running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed, on Monday. The LP candidates arrived at the rally site, Metropolitan Square, accompanied by their wives and party leaders, Daily Trust reports. According to him, “We have the magic wand to turn Nigeria around. We need leadership to secure and unite Nigeria, that is our number one promise. A new Nigeria is possible under the Labour Party. We don’t want a Nigeria where snakes and goats swallow money. “This year’s election, they will come to you with religion, tribe and money, but tell them you are hungry. Collect the money they will give to you because it is your money and vote for us. “We can build a Nigeria where everybody is happy. They have campaigned with umbrellas and brooms for over 16 years now but only achieved insecurity and economic woes. This is the time of the youth. Now go and vote for our symbol, father, mother and child’ to connect party politics with the people.” He stated that his ticket with Baba-Ahmed would ensure a proper place for the youth and urged them to mobilize for the election. Obi and his entourage had previously paid a visit to Ilorin's Emir, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, at his palace.
