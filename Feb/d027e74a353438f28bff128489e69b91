The Nigeria Police Force has warned that people caught attacking banks in protest against cash scarcity will be treated as armed robbers. The Force Spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi said this in a video posted on the NPF’s Facebook page on Friday. “We complain banks don’t attend to us yet we go to their facilities and set them ablaze, destroy ATMs. How do you want them to serve you better if you have destroyed their facilities?” Adejobi said. “I think we need to educate ourselves on what the law says about this. You don’t go to any bank, ATM, or financial institution to attack. It is criminal and tantamount to armed robbery. If you are caught in the act, you will be treated as an armed robber.” Hoodlums had on Friday violently attacked some commercial banks in the Epe area of Lagos State. The banks including Zenith, Key Stone, First Bank and United Bank for Africa (UBA) have temporarily suspended operations in Epe as a result of the attack, reports said. A source said the attack was a result of the inability of the masses to access cash from the affected banks, adding that the issue was being taken care of. The Epe incident occurred following an uprising on Friday morning at Ojota-Mile 12 area of the state which was quelled by security operatives.
