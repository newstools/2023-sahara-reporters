The appellate court on Friday voided and set aside the judgment of a High Court that recognised Mohammed Abacha as the party’s governorship candidate in the state. The Court of Appeal in Kano has restored Sadiq Wali as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the state in the 2023 election.  The appellate court on Friday voided and set aside the judgment of a High Court that recognised Mohammed Abacha as the party’s governorship candidate in the state. Mohammed is the son of the late Nigerian military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, who stole billions of dollars from the nation’s coffers. In December 2022, Justice Liman ordered the electoral body, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to publish the name of Mohammed Abacha as the governorship candidate of the party in the state, saying the only lawful primary election was the one monitored by INEC. With the judgement, the court nullified the primary election that produced Wali as the PDP governorship candidate for the state. But on Friday, the Appeal Court upturned the lower court judgement and ordered that Wali should be recognized as the authentic governorship candidate by INEC.  Justice Usman Musale, who read the judgment on behalf of a three-man-panel, held that only the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party can conduct the governorship primary election of a party. The judgement noted that Abacha did not participate in the primary election conducted by the party’s NEC which produced Wali.
