The ward is one of the most volatile in Kano state as it is the same ward the APC chairman, Abdullahi Abbas and the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) governorship candidate, Abba Kabir Yusuf, belong to, Daily Trust reports. There is a brewing tension in Chiranci community of Gwale local government area as supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and those of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) attack each other.  The ward is one of the most volatile in Kano state as it is the same ward the APC chairman, Abdullahi Abbas and the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) governorship candidate, Abba Kabir Yusuf, belong to, Daily Trust reports.  The ward was a scene of major electoral violence in 2019 when the two political gladiators had to vote at the same polling unit.  However, in 2023, INEC separated their polling units, assigning Abba Gida Gida and his families to a newly created polling unit a few meters away from the former.  But the recent fracas started a few minutes after the results of the election at the polling unit of the APC chairman were announced.  The fracas escalated when four polling units in the area were done with the collation of results and some had signed the results sheets.  While the reason for the clash is still sketchy, personnel of the police, immigration service, and civil defence corps among others tried to bring the situation under control.  A call for reinforcement was made while tear gas was shot repeatedly in an attempt to disperse the crowd.  Some journalists covering the elections narrowly escaped an attack at the polling unit.
