Amid the currency crisis, there has been a steady increase in the price of premium motor spirit (PMS) which has caused long queues at filling stations across the nation. A similar protest rocked the city on Friday, February 3, where some hoodlums within the popular Araromi Spare parts, Gate, took advantage of the protest and set ablaze a police station, stole the stationâ€™s Plasma TV, vandalised a branch of WEMA Bank in the area and looted some roadside shops. The protesters said Nigerians had been subjected to hardship, as they were unable to go about daily activities, hence the protest. The protesters accused POS operators of collaborating with bank officials to withdraw large sums of the new naira notes while ordinary persons get little amounts after queuing for long hours.
