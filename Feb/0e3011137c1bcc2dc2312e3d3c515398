The Oyo State branch of the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has waded into the case of rape inside the mosque in Ibadan where a Muslim woman was raped inside a mosque. A suspected thug, identified as Idris, had been alleged of raping a Muslim woman inside a mosque in Iwo Road area of Ibadan.

He was arrested by the police and the case has now been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID)”. Reacting to the incident, Ustadh Ibrahim Agunbiade, the ambassador of MURIC in Oyo State warned that the case must not be swept under the carpet. He said, “MURIC confirmed that the suspect is one Idris, a.k.a. Kesari Rekereke.
