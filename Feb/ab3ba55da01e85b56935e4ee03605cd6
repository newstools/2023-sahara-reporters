Abubakar, who spoke on Monday at a national conference on “Livestock Reforms and Mitigation of Associated Conflicts,” called on the Nigerian government to work towards dousing the tension and hardship the Naira policy and the Naira scarcity has caused. The Sultan of Sokoto, Sa'adu Abubakar, has asked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Nigerian government to keep politics aside and save the lives of Nigerians as the naira swap policy and its scarcity have resulted in acute hunger and frustration. Abubakar, who spoke on Monday at a national conference on “Livestock Reforms and Mitigation of Associated Conflicts,” called on the Nigerian government to work towards dousing the tension and hardship the Naira policy and the Naira scarcity has caused. TheCable quoted the monarch as saying that “The people are hungry. Is there money? No cash. People are angry and hungry. Let’s see how we can douse the tension. “Let’s keep politics aside. The issues of development especially for the common man (should be prioritised). These people that God Almighty gave leadership over could one day, God forbid, rise up (against us).” Speaking on herders-farmers clashes in the country, Abubakar said, “After all these English by professors, how do we get these developments down to the common man who is a farmer, the common Fulani man who doesn’t know anything about development in his life; he only cares about cattle. “I have been to Benue at least two times as sultan to sit with the governors and traditional rulers to discuss peace in the Benue valley. At the end of it, there are suggestions, but we throw them away. Nothing is done and we are back to square one. “Let this conference not be in the same manner. Let’s do it and let’s do well and now.”
