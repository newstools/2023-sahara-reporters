The people of the South-East are the best professionals but not the best politicians. Former Abia State Governor, Orji Kalu, who is currently the Chief Whip of the Senate, has dismissed the chances of Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, noting that Saturday election is not the best outing for the Igbo people. Kalu who said he is not sure that Nigerians are ready for a president from the South-East geopolitical zone, stressed that the people of the South-East need the support of five other regions for one of their own to get to Aso Rock. Kalu made this known on The 2023 Verdict, Channels Television’s special elections programme on Wednesday, adding that the people of the South-East are the best professionals but not the best politicians. He said; “It is not the best outing for us (Igbo people) because for you to become the President of Nigeria, you need other regions. “I’m well-experienced; I ran for President in 2007 and I’m not sure Nigerians are yet ready for a President of Igbo extraction. I’m not sure because I have tried to nose around that. We have five other regions to come up with and I am not sure.” “We do politics with emotions and I want Igbos to stop doing politics with emotions; I want Igbos to do practical politics,” he noted.
