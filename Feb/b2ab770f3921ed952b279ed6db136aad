Some reports on Sunday claimed the anti-graft agency raided the house of the presidential candidate of the ruling party and discovered N400 billion in cash. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has denied raiding the residence of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Some reports on Sunday claimed the anti-graft agency raided the house of the presidential candidate of the ruling party and discovered N400 billion in cash. But in a statement on Sunday signed by its Head of Media and Publicity, the EFCC urged the public to disregard the report, describing it as fake. It said, “The attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has been drawn to a report circulating in the social media, claiming that operatives of the Commission raided the home of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, standard-bearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the forthcoming presidential elections and recovered a humongous sum of N400billion. “The Commission wishes to state that no such operation was carried out by the EFCC. The public is enjoined to disregard the report as fake news.” According to the report described as fake by the EFCC, the agency raided Tinubu’s house and recovered the newly redesigned notes amounting to 400 billion from an underground space there. The report added that investigations were ongoing to find out the bank manager who made such an amount of money accessible to the APC candidate.
