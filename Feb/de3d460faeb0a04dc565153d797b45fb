The incident was confirmed to newsmen by the spokesperson for the state police command, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga. The police in Anambra State, Southeast Nigeria on Monday killed one gunman when gunmen terrorising the state and other parts of the South-East region attacked the Ogidi Police Station in Idemili North Local Government Area. The incident was confirmed to newsmen by the spokesperson for the state police command, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga. Ikenga said, “Today 13/2/2023 by 2:15 am, police operatives foiled an attack by armed men on the Ogidi Police station, demobilized one of the armed men, and recovered many expended cartridges and 25 litres of PMS.”  According to the police spokesperson, it was suspected that the assailants wanted to burn the police station. He said they arrived at the facility at about 2am in cars and on motorcycles.  Ikenga added, “They came in their numbers with an unmarked Toyota Hiace bus, a Toyota Hilux and three motorcycles, and started shooting indiscriminately and attempted to gain access into Ogidi Police Station, Idemili North.  “They were fiercely resisted by police officers on duty and due to the superior gunfire of the operatives, the hoodlums fled the scene while one of the armed men was neutralized by the operatives.”  He, however, added that the police facility is intact, and that no casualty was recorded on the side of the police. He said the area has been reinforced by the tactical teams of the command. Operation is ongoing and further details of the manhunt for the perpetrators will be revealed later, Ikenga said.
