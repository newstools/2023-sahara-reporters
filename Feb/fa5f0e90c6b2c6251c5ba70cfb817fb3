The government ordered security agencies in the state to investigate and prosecute any NGO still operating in the state in defiance of the directive.   The Zamfara State government has ordered all non-governmental organisations in the state to pack their belongings and leave the state immediately. The government ordered security agencies in the state to investigate and prosecute any NGO still operating in the state in defiance of the directive. The state government in a statement issued on Tuesday by the state’s security and home affairs commissioner, Mamman Tsafe, accused many NGOs in the state of engaging in illegal activities. The Governor Bello Matawalle-led government also ordered Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to cease any form of relationship with the NGOs, warning that it will heavily sanction any MDA that flouts the directive. In the statement, the government “noted that the majority of these illegal NGOs have not registered with the state in line with the laid down rules and regulations of the government”. “Some of them have also been found to be engaging in activities fueling insecurity in the state and its neighbourhood,” it said. Dropping the bombshell, it said, “Henceforth, the government orders all NGOs in the state to pack their belongings and leave the state immediately. “Ministries and Departments of government have been ordered to stop any further relationships with any NGO, as punitive measures will be taken against any MDAs found having any relationships with such NGOs. “Security agencies in the state are by this announcement directed to be vigilant to the NGOs. Security agencies are hereby directed to investigate and prosecute any NGOs operating in the state without due clearance from designated authorities. Results of such prosecutions are to be forwarded to this Ministry for records please.”
