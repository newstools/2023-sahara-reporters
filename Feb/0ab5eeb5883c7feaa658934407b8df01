This was contained in a press statement released by Muyiwa Adekeye, Special Adviser to the Governor (Media & Communication), stating that the directive is given in compliance with the Supreme Court directive on the naira swap policy. The Kaduna State Government has directed that both old and new naira notes should be accepted as legal tender by all state ministries, departments, and agencies. This was contained in a press statement released by Muyiwa Adekeye, Special Adviser to the Governor (Media & Communication), stating that the directive is given in compliance with the Supreme Court directive on the naira swap policy.  The statement reads: “KDSG asks agencies to accept payments in old and new notes. “In line with the subsisting order of the Supreme Court, the Kaduna State Government has directed its ministries, departments and agencies to ensure that their collection agents continue to accept payments made in all denominations of the naira, old and new. “The laws of Kaduna State do not allow personnel of government agencies to be involved in cash collection of revenues. The collection agents authorised by state government agencies do offer citizens a route for cash payment, and are expected to comply with the subsisting court order.”  In direct defiance of President Muhammadu Buhari's directive, the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, earlier asked residents of the state to accept the old N500 and N1000 notes as legal tender. El-Rufai issued the directive in a broadcast to residents of the state on Thursday night. During the broadcast, El-Rufai described the naira redesign policy as a weapon by members of the ruling party and close allies of President Muhammadu Buhari bent on stopping the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, from winning the 25 February election.
