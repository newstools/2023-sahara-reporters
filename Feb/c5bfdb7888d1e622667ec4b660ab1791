More than 3000 people have now been killed and thousands more injured after the catastrophic earthquake that hit the two countries overnight, flattening neighbourhoods while families were asleep. The President, National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS Turkish zone, Yakubu Sabo in a statement on Tuesday, said that some Nigerian students were traumatised and were undergoing post-trauma analysis, adding that they would be released once they were certified okay. He said, “Turkey is an earthquake prone area. Some of our new students were traumatised and have been taken in for post-shock analysis. They will be released as soon as they are certified okay. The old students are already used to it. We will provide more updates along the line.” Earthquakes are not uncommon in Turkey. The country is situated on the Anatolian plate which borders two major fault lines; the North Anatolian fault, which stretches across the country from west to east, and the East Anatolian fault, which is in eastern Turkey. The former has been the site of several disastrous earthquakes, according to the Geological Society of London, including the 1939 earthquake in north-eastern Turkey that resulted in the deaths of 30,000 people.
