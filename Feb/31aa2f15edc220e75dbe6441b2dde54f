Some hoodlums have attacked a church known as Motailatu Church of God, Oke-Idahun Parish in Akure, the Ondo state capital, setting it ablaze and destroying some properties.  The church, which is under the umbrella of the Cherubim and Seraphim sect, is located along Imafon Road, Akure North Local Government Area of the state.  Cherubim and Seraphim churches along with some others like them are popularly called 'white-garment churches'.  The Resident Minister of the church, Very Rev’d David Akinadewo-Adekahunsi, in a statement said the footprints of the arsonists were detected when he got to the church premises on Friday evening.  He disclosed that what first caught his attention was the damaged lectern placed on the altar, and some broken bottles that littered the church auditorium.  The clergyman, who is also a journalist, said many plastic chairs belonging to the church and offering trays were set ablaze within the church chancel.  Akinadewo-Adekahunsi added that hymn books and other items kept in a room in the building were not spared during what he called “the malicious damage brought upon the House of Prayer.”  He revealed that the completed prayer room of the church was also touched by the attackers, as they damaged the window nets, but could not gain access to the room because of the burglary proof. But they succeeded in damaging the tithe box.  The cleric, however, disclosed that the matter had been reported at the Oda Divisional Police Headquarters, Akure, and was assured that those behind the arson attack on the church would be apprehended.  On June 5, 2022, some terrorists attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo town, also in Ondo, killing 40 congregants and injuring several others.
