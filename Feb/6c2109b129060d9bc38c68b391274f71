The 39th President of the US was moved to hospice care on Saturday.  According to Mayo Clinic, hospice care is for people who are nearing the end of life. The services are provided by a team of healthcare professionals who maximise comfort for a person who is terminally ill by reducing pain and addressing physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs. "After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter today decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention," the Carter Center said in a statement posted on Twitter on Saturday. "The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers," the statement concluded.  Carter, 98, was the US President from 1977 to 1981. He emerged as President after defeating incumbent President Gerald Ford in 1976. The former president has survived health challenges including cancer, a broken hip and a fractured pelvis. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, are the longest-married couple in US presidential history.
