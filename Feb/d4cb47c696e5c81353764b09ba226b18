The vice-presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the forthcoming general elections, Haruna Magashi, has condemned the recent brutal attack on the students of the University of Benin by Nigerian soldiers. SaharaReporters on Friday reported how soldiers brutalised students of the university over the struggle to make withdrawals at an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in the school amid the scarcity of naira notes. Videos obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday showed soldiers brutalising the students along with several damaged vehicles. Some students were assaulted and brutalised by soldiers with sticks, cables, belts and other weapons. From the video, one of the brutalised students was left with a broken head, with blood dripping from his head all over his body. Reacting to the incident, Magashi said the soldiers did not behave professionally in their actions and must therefore be duly prosecuted in line with the provisions of the law. “What soldiers of the Nigerian Army did at the University of Benin is condemnable. It should never have happened. They have not behaved professionally and should be duly prosecuted as required by law,” he tweeted on Sunday.
