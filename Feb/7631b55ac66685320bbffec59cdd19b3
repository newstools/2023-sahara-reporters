Speculations are rife that this may be connected to the protest by citizens across the states regarding the cash crunch occasioned by the introduction of new naira notes and cashless policy. Bayelsa State Government on Monday announced the discontinuation of all activities in line to commemorate the third anniversary of Governor Douye Diri’s administration. Speculations are rife that this may be connected to the protest by citizens across the states regarding the cash crunch occasioned by the introduction of new naira notes and cashless policy. In a statement issued by Mr. Ayibaina Duba, information, orientation and strategy commissioner, no reason was given for the sudden suspension of the programmes. According to him, all the activities proposed for the anniversary will commence after the presidential election slated for February 25, 2023 . “The anniversary activities will now take place after the Presidential Election. We regret any inconveniences this suspension might have caused,” he said. Meanwhile, this comes 24 hours after the death of Pa Abraham Diri, the father of the state governor.
