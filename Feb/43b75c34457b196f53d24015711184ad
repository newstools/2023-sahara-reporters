A picture of Peter Obi, Enenche and Bishop David Oyedepo, founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, and presiding Bishop of the Faith Tabernacle in Ota, Ogun State was posted on the Twitter handle of Pastor Enenche. Dr Paul Enenche, the founder and senior pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre has blocked some his critics on his Twitter handle @DrPaulEnenche following his tacit endorsement of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi for the 2023 presidential election. A picture of Peter Obi, Enenche and Bishop David Oyedepo, founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, and presiding Bishop of the Faith Tabernacle in Ota, Ogun State was posted on the Twitter handle of Pastor Enenche. He wrote under the picture: "This picture is speaking volumes right now, especially in this season. What do you see? What can you hear? "Are you in doubt of the way to go? The way of integrity, authenticity, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, capacity, productivity; here is the way to go. #Elections2023." While the picture generated thousands of reactions for and against, Dr Enenche blocked only those who were critical of his open and soft endorsement of Peter Obi. One of the Twitter users who commented on his timeline wrote, "You're one of the few pastors that speak against bad governance and take a stand when others "haven't heard God speak" God bless you Dr Pastor Paul Idoko Enenche. And God prosper Daddy David Oyedepo and other Pastors talking. Imams would definitely speak against Christian-Christian." @diplo_soft who also posted tweets blocked by Enenche, wrote "A very very short story." He also wrote in a campaign picture of Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi in 2019 presidential election, "This isn't integrity, it's all pretence and lies."
