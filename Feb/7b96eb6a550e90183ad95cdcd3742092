This is just as branches of the bank across the country were closed to customers. Nigerians using Zenith Bank have taken over different social media platforms to lament the poor online services experienced as the scarcity of the newly redesigned notes worsens. This is just as branches of the bank across the country were closed to customers. Many customers of the bank reported visiting the bank’s branches only to find the gates locked. “Due to insecurity reasons, we did not open today,” a bank official told one of our correspondents. Since the advent of smartphones, a lot of Nigerians have made mobile app banking their preferred online digital platform for making financial transactions. Some Zenith bank customers have taken to Twitter to call out the financial institution. On Monday, a video appeared online, purportedly of staff members of Zenith Bank scaling the fence to escape from the bank premises following pressure from customers. The members of staff had hurdled close to a ladder that had been placed against the wall. In the video, men and women are seen climbing the ladder as they scaled the fence in their corporate outfits. One of the bankers, believed to be a senior official, could be seen making inquiries on the phone about the location of security personnel they had called to protect them from the mob attack. Below are some Twitter’s reactions: I believe anyone still using Zenith bank despite everything that has been happening for weeks absolutely deserve every shege they’re using your eyes to see. — LERRY 👑 (@_AsiwajuLerry) February 7, 2023 Zenith Bank has put their customers in Financial Jail ATM Card ain't working
