The speaker said the naira redesign is a well-thought-out policy, which has been hijacked and politicised. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has said the petrol and naira scarcity is a plot to stop the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, from winning the 2023 presidential election. Gbajabiamila during the launch of the second phase of a transport initiative, “Gbaja Ride”, in Lagos State on Tuesday also alleged that the petrol crisis and the cash crunch were caused by “some elements” to derail the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The speaker said the naira redesign is a well-thought-out policy, which has been hijacked and politicised. He said the plot seems to be failing as Nigerians are still keeping faith with the APC and Tinubu despite what they are going through. “Nobody can convince me that it is not a plot to stop Asiwaju from becoming the president of this country,” Gbajabiamila was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria. “But I am glad that our God is a wonderful being, as the plot these people sat together to hatch, He has intervened. “I have followed the campaign team to the east, north, and everywhere with Asiwaju and I doff my hat for Nigerians.” He said the House of Representatives is working hard to rescue citizens from the current hardships by bringing relief as soon as possible. “As your representative and speaker, I have a good understanding of the current hardships and discomfort being faced by many Nigerians, without exception to my constituents,” he said. “The lower legislative chamber under my leadership has been on the side of the people, working tirelessly to rescue them from these difficulties. “I am glad that the judiciary has also confirmed our position on the implementation of the policy of naira redesign.”
