The Nigerian government is expected to go to court with three states to challenge the Central Bank of Nigeria's implementation of the Cashless Policy Regime. At the time of writing, more than 100 Senior Advocates hired by the Nigerian government and the three aggrieved states had arrived in court to present their clients' cases. It was further on the Cause List of the court that Ondo State had teamed up with the three states in the legal battle. SaharaReporters had reported that the Supreme Court temporarily halted the Nigerian government's move to stop using old naira notes on February 10, 2023. This was stated in a ruling given by a seven-member panel led by Justice John Okoro for an ex parte application brought by three northern states of Kaduna, Kogi, and Zamfara. The three states had specifically applied for an order of Interim Injunction restraining “the federal government through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) or the commercial banks from suspending or determining or ending on February 10, 2023, the time frame with which the now older version of the 200, 500 and 1,000 denomination of the naira may no longer be legal tender pending the hearing and determination of their motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.”
