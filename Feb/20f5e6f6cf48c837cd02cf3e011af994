The various political party chairs were on the ground to monitor the distribution of the materials.  The Independent National Electoral Commission's office in the Federal Capital Territory's Bwari Area Council is heavily guarded as the commission is currently distributing sensitive and non-sensitive election materials to Registration Area Centres. Sensitive materials, including BVAS, ballot papers, and result sheets, arrived at the office in the early hours of the morning from the FCT INEC office. The various political party chairs were on the ground to monitor the distribution of the materials. Speaking on the distribution, INECâ€™s Assistant Area Officer Admin in the council, Veronica John, said there were 1940 polling units across the council and that the distribution of the sensitive materials from the Registration Area Centres to the polling units would commence at midnight. She said the commission was satisfied with the security arrangement in the area, adding that all the stakeholders including party representatives would monitor the distribution. According to her, accreditation and voting would go simultaneously in all the polling units. She said the office had received technical staff that would attend to any hitches that might occur with BVAS machines. She called on intending voters and other residents of the council to conduct themselves in an orderly manner. Some party representatives commended the transparency with which the materials were distributed. Daily Trust reports that generators, mats, chairs, tables are among non-sensitive materials being distributed at the office.
