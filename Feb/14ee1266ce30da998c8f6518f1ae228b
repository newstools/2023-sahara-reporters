Leading a five-member panel, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun delivered the judgment in Abuja on Wednesday. The Supreme Court has nullified the nomination of Emmanuel Bwacha as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba State.  Leading a five-member panel, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun delivered the judgment in Abuja on Wednesday.  On September 20, 2022, SaharaReporters reported that a Federal High Court in Jalingo, the state capital had nullified the election of Bwacha as the APC governorship candidate in the state. The court also ordered that a fresh primary election be conducted by the party to get a new governorship candidate.  The court ruling on Bwachaâ€™s candidature followed a petition filed before the court by one of the aspirants, David Sabo Kente. Kente had approached the court with evidence that no governorship primary election was held in Taraba.  However, the Court of Appeal (Yola division) later reinstated Bwacha as the governorship candidate of the party in the state.  In a unanimous decision, the 3-man panel led by Justice Tani Yusuf Hassan set aside the judgment of the trial court. The Supreme Court aligned with the judgement of the Federal High Court which held that the APC did not conduct a valid governorship primary election in Taraba State from which Bwacha emerged as the winner.
