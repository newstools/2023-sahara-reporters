The suspect allegedly made Sayers finance the execution of the contract until the petitioner contacted the ministry with the contract papers and discovered that they were fake. Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday arrested one Chidozie Kingsley Nwachi, aka Dozie over an alleged fake marriage to an American woman identified as Nicole Kierulff Sayers, and for defrauding her of $200,000. The EFCC in a statement explained that Nwachi was arrested in Abuja based on the claims of Sayers who reported to the agency and alleged that the suspect lured her into a false marriage and defrauded her of her savings. The anti-graft agency quoted Sayers as saying, “I was accustomed to transferring money to him and further felt I had no choice since I had just married him, even though I did not feel confident in my choice to have married him.” According to the agency, Nwachi’s ploy of defrauding his “wife” was the offer of a phoney contract by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Abuja. The suspect allegedly made Sayers finance the execution of the contract until the petitioner contacted the ministry with the contract papers and discovered that they were fake. After realizing that Nwachi had sold her a dummy, Sayers lamented, “I have been suicidal on and off when I realised he was a fraudster, as I was drowning financially and facing bankruptcy.” The EFCC said that upon Nwachi’s arrest, the operatives recovered two cars including a Toyota Venza and a Lexus ES300, expensive wristwatches, two Apple iPhones, two iPhone laptops, a passport and multiple Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards. Also, a sum of $2,204 was recovered from him. “He will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded,” the agency said.
