Voters Stranded As Late Arrival Of Materials Delay Election Process In Enugu A relatively large turnout of voters has been recorded across Enugu state despite the late arrival of election materials to many polling units.  SaharaReporters observed that the late arrival and malfunctioning of BVAS machines delayed the process in some units.  Our correspondent monitoring the exercise within the capital city reports that as of 10:30 am, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and materials were yet to arrive at polling units at Idaw River Primary School, Uwani Secondary School, Obiagu Primary School, New Haven Secondary school, Practicing Schools, Emene, and Annunciation Hospital. Late arrival of election materials was also recorded in some polling stations in Ibeagwa Nike in the state. Some voters who spoke to our correspondent expressed dismay over the delay but maintained that they were determined to wait and cast their votes.  Mr Lucky Chizorom who spoke at Ward 36, polling unit 17, Enugu, said, "This is 9:33 am and there are no INEC officials and INEC told Nigerians that they are ready and election will start exactly 8:30 am. We are over 300 people here but the election is yet to commence. We are not happy. I am not happy with the INEC logistics here.  "Despite the threats of sit-at-home, people came out as early as 7:30 am to wait for INEC. I hope that nobody in the South East is disenfranchised because in the North where bandits and Islamic terrorists are ravaging, they started this election as early as 8:30 am. It is regrettable that in the city centre in Enugu State capital, election has yet to start."
