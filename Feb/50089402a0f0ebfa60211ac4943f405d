However, he noted that they are hampered by the immunity governors enjoy in the country. The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali, has said that the Nigeria Police Force is investigating state governors whose utterances are considered to have incited Nigerians to resort to riots over the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) naira redesign policy.  However, he noted that they are hampered by the immunity governors enjoy in the country.  Alkali disclosed this on Wednesday while briefing journalists alongside the Attorney General of Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, after a meeting of the National Security Council presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.  The police boss however said that despite the investigation, the police cannot prosecute the state governors as they still enjoy their official immunity, Tribune reports.  On why the governors had not been cautioned, the IGP said, “We all know why unless you want to hear from the mouth of the Attorney General. We are investigating, we are investigating. Whoever does anything can be investigated.  “But for him to be investigated, some people have immunity. I think that is some of the reasons. But that will not stop us from cautioning, warning, or advising them, and we are doing so. That’s for the incitement by governors.”  Many governors led by the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, had openly stood against the naira redesign policy. The governors have on some occasions asked Nigerians not to comply with the expiration of the legality of the old N500 and N1,000 notes.
