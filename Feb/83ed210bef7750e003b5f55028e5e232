A source in Kaduna also revealed how agents of the ruling party shared clothes, and bags of rice as well as transferred money to the electorate to entice them to vote for their parties. “Voting going on well and the BVAS machines are working effectively, although there is a case of bribery where APC agent gives voters clothes and bag of rice, some even collect their ‘reward’ through transfer,” the source said.
