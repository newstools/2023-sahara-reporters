The Supreme Court had temporarily suspended the February 10 deadline given by the apex bank. The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) on Wednesday called on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria to respect the Supreme Court ruling on the February 10, 2023 deadline for the swapping of old naira notes for newly redesigned ones.  The group in a statement posted on its Twitter page on Wednesday said, "The Supreme Court order stopping the CBN from implementing the February 10, 2023 deadline for swapping of old Naira notes for the redesigned Naira notes, remains valid. The CBN must obey the order." The Supreme Court had temporarily suspended the February 10 deadline given by the apex bank.  A seven-member panel of the court, led by John Okoro, gave the order of interim injunction amid an acute scarcity of newly redesigned N200, N500, and N1,000 currency notes.  The court gave the order temporarily, cancelling the CBN’s February 10 deadline to end the validity of the old versions of the banknotes based on an ex parte application filed by Kaduna, Kogi and Zamfara states.  Also, SERAP called on President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to “promptly investigate reports that four persons, including a nursing mother, were today killed in Benin, Edo State, during protests over the scarcity of new Naira notes”.  “The perpetrators must be immediately arrested and prosecuted,” the organisation said.
