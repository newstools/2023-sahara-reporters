SaharaReporters on November 28, 2022, reported that the election of the Speaker of Adamawa House of Assembly, Aminu Iya Abbas, as the senatorial candidate of the PDP, had been nullified by a Federal High Court in Yola. During the PDP senatorial primary election conducted on May 23, 2022, Iya Abbas defeated Auwal Bamanga Tukur, D. D. Azura, Mohammed Modibbo, Ibrahim Mustapha, Ibrahim Abubakar and Abdullahi Prambe. However, Iya Abbas' victory was challenged at the court through originating summons by Mohammed Modibbo, asking the court to void the primary election on the premise that Auwal Tukur was allowed to participate in the contest while serving as the chairman of the Governing Council of Adamawa State University. Justice Anka, in his ruling on the suit filed by Mohammed Modibbo versus PDP and four others, voided the senatorial primary election for Adamawa Central conducted by the PDP. However, Abbas who immediately appealed against the judgment got his ticket restored on Friday.
