The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended elections in at least 141 polling units of Bayelsa state.  This was made known by Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman during a press briefing in Abuja on Friday. According to the INEC chairman, the elections were postponed because the voting process was disrupted.  He said: "We met the security agencies and we have decided that all these 141 polling units where the materials are actually intact will take place tomorrow morning.  "In Lagos, we have been closely following the situation in Okota, Mafoluku, Oshodi and Elebushi. We have been able to normalize the situation in a number of places including Ikotun where voting is ongoing.  "So we keep our eyes on the processes to the other areas we have mentioned.‚Äù  The Commission earlier cancelled the elections in seven polling units in Kogi East senatorial district.  Two polling units were cancelled in Anyigba while the other five were in the Omala community of the state.  The cancellation was said to have followed an attack by thugs who shot into the air and disrupted the polling units.  The attack brought an abrupt end to voting in the areas.  One of the polling units cancelled was Unit 01, Abejukolo ward in Omala Local Government Area.
