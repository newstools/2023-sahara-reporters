The CAN leader urged all political parties and candidates seeking elective positions during the elections to accept the results of the polls in good faith. The national leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged Nigerians to resist any attempt to cause disharmony and disaffection ahead of the upcoming general elections. CAN president, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, made the call Friday in Abuja. According to him, Nigerians must see the elections as a time of peaceful transition of leadership and not war, hence the need for all and sundry to put away religious and ethnic bigotry and allow the will of God to prevail. “The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) must ensure that this election is seamless, credible, and violence-free. The commission has no excuse to fail. Four years is enough time for it to have perfected the process and eliminated the glitches that featured in past polls. “CAN calls on the authorities to beef up security, especially in communities vulnerable to attacks and ensure that no citizen is disenfranchised owing to precarious security situation in parts of the country,” Okoh said. He also charged security agencies to be unbiased and remain neutral while discharging their duties, especially during the coming elections. The CAN leader urged all political parties and candidates seeking elective positions during the elections to accept the results of the polls in good faith in the interest of Nigerians and the unity of the country. “We note the current sufferings of the people which are gradually becoming unbearable due to the gross shortage of Naira notes in the system and plead with President Muhammadu Buhari to intensity efforts to mitigate the hardship,” he added.
