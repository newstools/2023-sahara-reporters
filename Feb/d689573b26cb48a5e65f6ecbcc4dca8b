In an interview with BBC Hausa service, Atiku said he is also holding talks with the Labour Party (LP) Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has said that he is in touch with the presidential candidate of the New Nigerian People Party (NNPP) Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso for possible support in the forthcoming general elections. In an interview with BBC Hausa service, Atiku said he is also holding talks with the Labour Party (LP) Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi. He said the duo of Obi and Kwankwaso were not in any way a threat to his chances in the election. “I see no threat because we are not together with them (Kwankwaso and Obi). We are in talk with them, one of them may possibly come,” he told the BBC. On the lingering PDP Crisis, Atiku said, “Each party has its internal crisis; we are still talking with them. Most are neither in PDP nor in other parties and definitely that will not make us lose the election because we are okay with the elections preparations for now. “Elections now are not like in the past when a governor will dictate who to vote for, elections today are in the hands of the voters.” The presidential candidate also promised to open all Nigeria’s borders if elected president.
