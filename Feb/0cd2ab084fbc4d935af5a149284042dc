 The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), says there would be no sit-at-home or election boycott in the South-East region on election days, advising Ndigbo to ignore any such calls. MASSOB, the most pro-Biafra agitation group, however, charged residents of the South-East to come out en mass on the election day and vote for their preferred candidates without any fear of intimidation or harassment from any group. "There shall be no sit-at-home on the days of elections," MASSOB declared in statement issued on Wednesday, through its National Director of Information, Comrade Samuel Edeson. The statement partly read, "Do not allow anybody to deceive you in the name of Biafra, because we know the real Biafra agitators and those paid to create confusion in our land. "MASSOB insists that election must hold in Igbo land because we cannot allow the enemies of Ndigbo to destroy our God-given land. "It is clear that some enemies of Ndigbo has bought over some of our brothers, brainwashed them and turned them against their own people, that's why they went about killing our own people, destroying our economy and making life difficult for our people. "MASSOB wishes to make it clear, that as we move on with Biafra project which is the restoration of Independent State of Biafra, we will not allow Igbo land to remain in vacuum, that is why we advise Ndigbo to go out and vote for their preferred candidates on the 25th day of February 2023. "Any group or persons saying that there shall be no election in Biafra land are enemies of Ndigbo, and should be disregarded. If you don't vote that day others will, and the enemies of Ndigbo will impose their puppet on our people just like what happened in Imo State. "MASSOB has directed all her members to go and vote for all our candidates on the day of election."
