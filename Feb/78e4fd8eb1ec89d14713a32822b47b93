Diran Onifade, Head of Media for Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, in a statement issued on Wednesday, Onifade said Obi was not in talks with Atiku or any other candidate. The Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council has denied that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi is in talks with Atiku Abubakar, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party,=. Diran Onifade, Head of Media for Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, in a statement issued on Wednesday, Onifade said Obi was not in talks with Atiku or any other candidate. Atiku had said that he was in touch with the presidential candidates of the Labour Party and New Nigerian People Party (NNPP), Obi and Rabi’u Kwankwaso respectively for possible support in the forthcoming elections. In an interview with BBC Hausa service, Atiku said he was holding talks with both presidential candidates, adding that the duo were not in any way a threat to his chances in the election. However, Onifade stressed that Peter Obi is the frontrunner in the race and therefore not in any talks to step down for any candidate. “We have been inundated with enquiries about the claim of an ongoing discussion between our Presidential ticket and the camp of PDP’s Presidential Candidate, Atiku Abubakar. “For emphasis, we wish to repeat, as we have said all day, that the claim is totally false and baseless. We are not in any talks with Atiku or anyone else with a view to stepping down from a race in which we are the frontrunner. “Peter Obi is in the contest to win in consonance with the aspiration of the majority of Nigerians who desire a New Nigeria devoid of lies, corruption and selfish scheming,” he said. “I see no threat because we are not together with them (Kwankwaso and Obi). We are in talk with them, one of them may possibly come,” Atiku had told BBC Hausa.
