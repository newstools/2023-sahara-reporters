A chieftain of the Labour Party, Wale Okunniyi says the party’s presidential candidate Peter Obi will power to victory by noon on Saturday.  Top contenders in the race include Omoyele Sowore of the African Action Congress; Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress; Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Obi.  Speaking on Channels Television on Thursday, Okunniyi, who is the National Chief Mobiliser of Labour Party pinned his argument on what he described as the LP’s organic support.  “My optimism tells me that by the first ballot straight (Peter Obi would have won). My analyses give me that optimism and the level of hard work some of us have put in inform that optimism that by first ballot (Obi would have won). “You will be shocked by 12 noon when you see… It would be clear that we have won. I am telling you what I have analysed,” he said.  When the interviewer noted that voting official ends by 2:30 pm, the Head, Grassroots Mobilization, of the Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), said before then, it would be obvious that Obi has won the election.  “Some of us will know by 12 noon; we will know what has happened. You will know that we have won. It may not be official but you will know now when there is a trend,” he said.  “By 2:30 pm that voting ends, it is just to collate. If you are in a polling unit for instance, and you see the trend and you have canvassers, information would have gotten to you,” Okunniyi maintained.  According to him, with the enthusiasm shown so far by Nigerians, voting should end early Saturday.  “In my polling unit, what has happened so far is that in three hours it is clear (who the winner is) and the INEC officials would just be playing,” he continued.
