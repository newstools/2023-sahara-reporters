SaharaReporters had reported that some gunmen on January 14, 2023 attacked Ugochinyere's country home in Akokwa, Ideato-North local government area of Imo State, killing his uncle and razing his house and about 30 cars parked in the compound. The Tuesday's attack is coming three weeks after the initial attack in which he escaped alive by the whiskers. Ugochinyere who’s also the House of Representative candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Ideato North and Ideato South Federal Constituency, had raised the alarm about the attack by the gunmen at his residence, via an SOS message on WhatsApp, calling for help. Shortly after resuming his campaign after mourning, Ugochinyere has once again raised alarm over the attack on his house by gunmen. In his SOS message sent to journalists on Tuesday via WhatsApp, Ugochinyere said, “SOS, we are under attack again. My house is under attack again by armed men with explosives and heavy gunfire.”
