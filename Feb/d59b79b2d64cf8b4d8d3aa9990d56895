 Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday morning, held a meeting with the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting, which took place at Buhari's official residence, explained his 40-minute delay in arriving at the Council Chambers to chair this week's Federal Executive Council meeting, according to senior presidency sources. PUNCH gathered that Buhari arrived at the Council Chambers at around 10:40 am, about an hour after the usual time of 10:00 am. The meeting is coming amid nationwide protests on Wednesday over fuel and naira notes scarcity which had paralysed many businesses of Nigerians and may have drowned what remained of the APC’s fortunes in the forthcoming general elections. Meanwhile a source said Buhari’s delay on Wednesday was premised in his decision to monitor the outcome of the Supreme Court’s ruling against the federal government and the Central Bank of Nigeria on the latter’s new naira policy. However, SaharaReporters had reported that the apex court had adjourned the hearing to Wednesday, February 22. Afterward, Buhari proceeded to the Council Chambers where several ministers and cabinet members were waiting.
