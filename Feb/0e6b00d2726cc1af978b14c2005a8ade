Hon. Ipalibo Yellowe, Chief of Staff to the council chairman disclosed this in an internal memo to the appointees, obtained by SaharaReporters. All political appointees of the Degema Local Government Area in Rivers State have been directed to canvass support and vote for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Hon. Ipalibo Yellowe, Chief of Staff to the council chairman disclosed this in an internal memo to the appointees, obtained by SaharaReporters. They were however asked to support candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party vying for National Assembly positions. “All appointees of Degema Local Government Council are by this notice, directed to canvass support and vote massively for the Presidential Candidate of the APC, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for the presidential category, coming up this Saturday, February, 25, 2023, whereas other National Assembly candidates (Senatorial and House of Representatives) in the same election remain PDP. “You are to collaborate with other party leaders and stakeholders in your various wards to implement this directive. Kindly note that noncompliance and sabotage will be met with severe consequences,” it read. The PDP has been in turmoil since it held its presidential primary election in May 2022. Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, a member of the party, was among the 12 presidential aspirants of the party who were defeated by the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar at the presidential primary after the dramatic withdrawal of Aminu Tambuwal from the race. Tambuwal had asked his supporters to support the former vice-president. The crisis in the party escalated after Atiku chose Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, as his running mate Wike was said to have been preferred by a majority of the PDP’s national working committee (NWC) members as the candidate for the position.
