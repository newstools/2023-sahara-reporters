President Buhari stated in December 2022 that he would campaign with "full energy and conviction" for Tinubu and other party candidates. The APC presidential campaign council announced in January that the president would attend the party's presidential rally in Lagos, as well as nine other states. Adamawa, Cross River, Katsina, Imo, Yobe, Kwara, Katsina, Ogun, and Nasarawa are among the states on the list. Buhari described Tinubu as "reliable" in a special video message on Sunday, adding that his party's candidate is a true believer in Nigeria. “I am not a contestant in this election, but my party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has a candidate in the person of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. As I mentioned before, Tinubu is a true believer in Nigeria, who loves the people and the development of our country,” the president said in the broadcast.
