The SDP presidential candidate said, "We need to save our people from being used as Guinea pigs any time we want to take electoral advantage or we want to stop electoral advantage".  The presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prince Adewole Adebayo, has condemned the hardship Nigerians are going through as a result of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) cashless policy and the persisting scarcity of new Naira notes. Nigerians across the country have been groaning and protesting over the excruciating hardship the policy and the scarcity of the new Naira notes have unleashed which led some businesses including some commercial banks being shut down. Speaking at the interactive session of the leading presidential candidates with the Compatriots in Abuja on Tuesday, Adebayo said that Nigerians should not be treated as guinea pigs by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Nigerian government just because it wanted to stop one or two political parties from bribery and vote buying during elections. The SDP presidential candidate said, "We need to save our people from being used as Guinea pigs any time we want to take electoral advantage or we want to stop electoral advantage. "I do not agree that people who are working very hard - tailors, carpenters, fishermen, anybody, should have their money confiscated by the state just because we want to stop one or two political parties from bribing people in elections if that is the policy. "That is too draconian and that is too far and the people suffer a lot. We should try as much as possible to use other measures and try to make election year; election season not to be too traumatic for the Nigerian people."
