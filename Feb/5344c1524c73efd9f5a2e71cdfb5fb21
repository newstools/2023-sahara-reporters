The Zamfara Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate, Dauda Lawal, has accused the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) of sponsoring thugs to attack and disrupt the PDP campaign rally in the Talata Mafara Local Government Area. SaharaReporters gathered that hoodlums suspected to be political thugs attempted to disrupt the Talata Mafara campaign rally organised by the PDP in the Local Government Area of the state. Reacting to the development, the Dauda Lawal Media Center, in a statement issued by its Coordinator in Gusau, noted that the sponsored thugs wielding dangerous weapons stormed and attacked the campaign rally in their number. The party accused ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), for being responsible for the incident. The statement reads in part, “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has so far campaigned in 11 Local Government Areas in Zamfara state, and among all the places, it is only in Talata Mafara LGA that we experienced such an incident of the unprovoked attack. “We started our campaign in a peaceful and orderly manner, received by a large crowd of supporters and well wishers in the Mafara town. “We had a very successful outing in Talata Mafara despite being the hometown of a former APC governor. We believe the rousing welcome received by our governorship candidate was what pushed the APC sponsored thugs to attack us. “We also believed that the attack was meant to disrupt our campaign. "It was the police escort that dispersed the fully armed thugs as the campaign rally continued. We have recorded numbers of injured supporters who are currently receiving treatments in the hospital. “We condemn the actions of these sponsored thugs and urge security operatives to investigate the incident and bring the culprits to justice.”
