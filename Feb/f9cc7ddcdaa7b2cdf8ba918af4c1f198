Oyedepo noted that democracy would ensure the emergence of “any candidate notwithstanding their political party, tribe or religion.” The founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide (Winners), Bishop David Oyedepo, has urged Nigerians to vote wisely in the 2023 general elections to enthrone credible leadership. Oyedepo noted that democracy would ensure the emergence of “any candidate notwithstanding their political party, tribe or religion.” The cleric made the call in Ota, Ogun State, on Thursday while speaking at a three-day fasting and prayer programme for hitch-free general elections in the country. He urged Nigerians to scrutinise the character and capacity of those seeking their votes before making decisions. Oyedepo, also the chancellor of the Covenant University, Ota, urged Nigerians to analyse every contestant’s antecedents and service record critically. “The presidential election is just a few days away. We are believing God for a hitch-free exercise. We should all do our parts to ensure a credible exercise,” said Mr Oyedepo. The Winners’ spiritual head explained that every political party or tribe in the country had people with the requisite qualifications to lead the nation. “There is also no political party or tribe in the country without incompetent and character-deficient individuals. No tribe is indecent. We only have indecent people in every tribe, religion, and political party,” Oyedepo explained. He urged Nigerians, irrespective of tribe or religion, to defend the nation’s democracy, unity and national integrity. “It is our collective duty to secure the future of our children and the posterity of our great nation. Democracy provides us an open access for any candidate notwithstanding their political party, tribe or religion,” added Oyedepo.
