Nigeria will hold general elections on February 25, 2023, to elect the President and Vice President, as well as members of the Senate and House of Representatives. Nigeria's President is elected in a modified two-round system. A candidate must receive a plurality of valid votes and more than 25% in at least 24 of the 36 states to be elected in the first round. If no candidate meets this criterion, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the candidate who received the most votes in the most states. SaharaReporters had reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission had expressed its readiness to conduct a presidential run-off election should there be a need for it after the 2023 presidential election. This was stated by the commission’s national chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu while answering questions at the Chatham House in London on Tuesday. According to the INEC chairman, the previous position of the law regarding the conduct of run-off elections made it practically impossible for the commission to conveniently hold it.
