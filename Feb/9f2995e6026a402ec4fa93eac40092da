Although the cause of the explosion was yet to be ascertained, SaharaReporters gathered that incident caused pandemonium among nearby residents. A powerful explosion has reportedly occurred at a gas plant at Efurrun, Uvwie Local Government Council Area of Delta State, South-South Nigeria. Although the cause of the explosion was yet to be ascertained, SaharaReporters gathered that incident caused pandemonium among nearby residents. The gas station identified as NELMIC Gas Plant which is located opposite the Effurun Post Office was said to have gone aflame 10:30pm on Monday night. Reports claimed that several people were injured while it was not clear whether anyone died during the unfortunate incident when the inferno tried to spread to residential buildings and a popular Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in the area. A resident of the area identified as Gweke, told TNV News that the fire incident started around 10:30pm, adding that they saw balls of fire lightening up the dark sky from their houses, before a loud sound of powerful explosion followed. “Some of us started running out of our houses to know where the fire and explosion came from. We later saw it was from the gas plant close to us. “I pray nobody died but I doubt it. This fire I am seeing must have taken some lives,” he narrated. The few vehicles on the busy Warri-Sapele road at that hour avoided that portion of the road as some persons were seen trying to take pictures of the scenes with their phones and uploading them on their social media accounts. Another eyewitness, Sunday Musa, said, "I saw it from far as Ginuwa road, and I suddenly saw huge red flames in the sky that just lasted some seconds and began to wonder what it was. Thanks to God for we have not recorded any casualty. “What I had was like a thunderous sound. The explosion has completely destroyed the gas plant.”
