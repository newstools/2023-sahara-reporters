We can't deride a mentally ill man for shouting and calling our attention to a man caught in a fit of epilepsy in the marketplace just because we know his own health challenge is worse than epilepsy. It's to the advantage of society when evil sees evil things and shouts than when saints see evil things and keep quiet without taking a stand. There's a reversal of role here.  We can't deride a mentally ill man for shouting and calling our attention to a man caught in a fit of epilepsy in the marketplace just because we know his own health challenge is worse than epilepsy.  It's just like no reasonable parent will blame a notorious drug addict for reporting to them that their child has joined the narcotic gang in the neighbourhood.  Can a wayward flirty mother blame and correct her wayward daughter as many mothers do? Can a drunk father advise his son to abstain from alcohol?  Can an armed robber not in operation report a robbery incident to the police? Can a kidnapper report an armed robber to the police? Yes, because society is better served than for them to keep quiet. Reverse morality is better than moral paralysis.
