The lawyer in a statement said his conviction and opinions should not constitute a threat to the ambition of any politician or a threat to the life of any advocate. The Rule of Law and Accountability Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), a civic group, has asked the Nigerian government and security agencies to ensure the safety of human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa. Adegboruwa had during the weekend raised an alarm over alleged threat to his life and safety as a result of his advocacies and actions in relation to the campaign for good governance, rule of law and accountability. The lawyer in a statement said his conviction and opinions should not constitute a threat to the ambition of any politician or a threat to the life of any advocate. He stated that while his views and actions may seem to antagonise or support certain political tendencies depending on the divide, he has no allegiance to any political party. The human rights lawyer then appealed to Nigerians, the international community, friends, colleagues and fellow patriots to hold the government and the security agencies accountable should anything happen to him. Reacting, RULAAC in a statement by its Executive Director, Okechukwu Nwanguma said Adegboruwa was not a criminal nor a terrorist and should be protected by the government. The statement read, “RULAAC condemns all forms of threats to the safety and liberty of any advocate of justice, accountability and good governance or any citizen whatsoever for holding or expressing opinions in exercise of his or her constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. “RULAAC calls on the Federal Government and security agencies to guarantee the safety and liberty of Human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa. “Adegboruwa is a patriot; a reputable advocate of good governance, human rights, rule of law and justice. He is not a criminal or terrorist. No harm must come to him.”
