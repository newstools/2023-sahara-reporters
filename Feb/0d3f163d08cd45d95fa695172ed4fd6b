SaharaReporters gathered that the gunmen invaded the community as voting was already in process. Then they started shooting sporadically and carted away result sheets, ballot papers and other sensitive voting materials at units 5, 6, 7, 8, 14 and 15. Multiple sources in the community revealed that the gunmen were not political thugs but a group of young men known for oil theft in the community. The sources said they mobilized to attack the units during the elections as a way of expressing their grievances after they were stopped from engaging in oil theft.  At the time of filing this report, our correspondent gathered that voting has not commenced in the affected polling units. However, members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been pointing accusing fingers at each other for sponsoring the armed men. It was gathered that some stakeholders in the affected units have called for the cancellation of the elections in the affected units.
