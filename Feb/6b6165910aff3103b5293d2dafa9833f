The Quickest Way To Kill A Nation  1  Pepeye, nigba too m’owe Ki lo be l’udo se?*   Incompetence weds Corruption** And a dark, unruly tragedy is born As the Nation thrashes about Like a snake without a head  Do you really wonder Why so much power Should be thrust upon Those with so little sense  Do you wonder why Those with no eyes Have forced their way To the fore front of our chase?  They who have no heads Have stolen our caps Those with no legs Have taken over the daintiest of our trousers  Toasting the talisman of tribe and tongue Invoking the charisma of creed and class They sneak their serpents Into the quietest corner of our garden  Jumble up the geography Of our bearings And exploit the sorrowful saga Of our grand un-remembrances  Always, the wrong foot forward Then our tales of incessant woes How can a land so lavishly endowed Be so medievally misruled?  The mindless clique who rule our pack Have killed our soul and frittered our faith Those incapable of thinking Have now turned our “Leaders of Thought”   2  Lukurumusu wrested our Golden Crown And headed straight for the putrid mud His mouth stuffed with the corpses Of assassinated oaths   Fierce and frequent was His quest for that Crown He crawled, caviled cajoled, cried in countless bids Till a mongrel coalition rewarded his frenzy   Now up in the saddle And finding, so fast, the Crown Too big for his middling head As an unraveling Nation rues its fatal choice   The Nation bleeds from all pores Old separatist animosities re-draw the map As Luku retreats into a conclave of clan and cronies Merit and Good Judgement his prime disposable virtues   Clan over competence, tribe above truth Square pegs in round holes And the Nation grabs the reverse gear And speeds, break-neck, into medieval darkness    3   Now Bandits stoke our fears An oil-drenched Nation lacks The brain to power its progress A mindless paint-over of a battered currency  Has thrown the nation’s debt-drained economy into a tailspin The ‘cashless’ country dreamed up by Emefailure, Chief Witchdoctor of the National Vault, Has turned Nigeria into the saddest joke of the Universe  From the rocky seat of power It has been silence, empty, disdainful silence But why did Luku fight so hard for this Crown When he knew it was too heavy for his head?   Unspeakable hardships harass our being Untimely deaths deplete our ranks There is not a single corner in this land Untouched by this plague from our mindless Pharaoh   Unhappy the land where rulers cannot THINK And/or are too haughty to know The world asks with impatient consternation: Why is Lukuland such a Netherworld of Fools?   Ignorance kills a Nation Our own is already close to a disgraceful grave What do you do with/to a Nation Which so conscientiously disables the able?   ---------------------- * Oh Duck, why your frantic craving for the river When you knew you lacked the power to swim?  ** For more on Meritocracy and Competence, see Nigeria and I: Getting Politics Right to Make Nigeria Work, by Ladipo Adamolekun   Feb. 2, 2023 Niyi Osundare
