A fresh crisis is brewing in the Zamfara chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a serving Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Alhaji Aliyu Tukur Mafara under Governor Bello Matawalle-led government defected to  the  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The Commissioner in a press briefing in Gusau on Friday declared his defection from the ruling APC and pledged full support for the candidacy of the Zamfara PDP governorship candidate, Dauda Lawal. Alhaji Mafara was among the key figures in the Zamfara chapter of APC and a grassroots politician. While addressing the journalist immediately after a close-door meeting with the Zamfara PDP governorship candidate, the former commissioner reiterated that his conscience would not allow him to stick to failure. He said: “I informed the state government, former governor, and all my supporters prior to my defection from the APC to the PDP. “I am doing this for the people, and it is my conviction that Dr. Dauda Lawal, if given the opportunity at the forthcoming election to govern Zamfara State, would tackle the problem of security, boost agricultural production, and create good markets for farm produce. “For this, I declare my total support for the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), and I want to call on all my supporters across Zamfara to support and vote for Dauda Lawal and PDP in the forthcoming general elections.” On his part, the Zamfara PDP governorship candidate Dauda Lawal affirmed Zamfara as fully a PDP state stressing that the party would have a resounding victory in the 2023 elections. This is a defection that brews serious tension in the Zamfara State government house and the state chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC).
