A yet-to-be-identified bank customer has slumped and died after spending hours at a generation bank in Agbor, Delta State, South-South Nigeria. An eyewitness account said the customer died after futile attempts to withdraw cash from the bank but the police have dismissed the account, saying the customer was at the bank to collect his Automated Teller Machine card. SaharaReporters gathered that incident happened on Thursday in the Ika South Local Government Area of the state. Confirming the incident to SaharaReporters, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, in the state, DSP Bright Edafe, said the deceased was in the bank to collect his ATM card. "He was not trying to withdraw cash, he came to collect his ATM card," he said. Nigerians have decried the painful experience they endure in commercial banks to withdraw cash following the redesign of N200, N500 and N1000 banknotes by the Central Bank of Nigeria and the attendant scarcity. Many banks and ATMs have not been dispensing cash â€“ either old or new notes. Some frustrated bank customers including Point of Sale operators have lamented how they visited different banks but could not make withdrawals at the counter or from ATMs. Meanwhile, some banks have been rationing cash dispensed to customers with some paying a maximum of N1,500 per customer.
