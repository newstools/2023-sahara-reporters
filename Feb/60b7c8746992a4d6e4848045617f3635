About seven people had been saved and taken to the hospital. No fewer than 50 persons were trapped when a two-storey commercial structure under construction in the Federal Capital Territory, Gwarinpa District collapsed on Thursday afternoon. Two people were also reported dead, though the cause of the tragic incident could not yet be ascertained at the time of filing this report. The incident was confirmed by the Director of Development Control for the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Muktar Galadima, who said that a rescue effort was underway with the help of a team from multiple agencies. He said approximately seven people had been saved and taken to the hospital. Although there had been no confirmed casualties, he said that numerous workers were still under the rubble. According to an eyewitness, John Edwin, the workers on the site, especially labourers conveying blocks to the top, were over 50. He claimed to have lived in the area for many years, and that he had always known the place to be a reserved green area. Edwin urged relevant authorities to call the management of Federal Housing Authority to question, for illegally allocating Green areas to commercial complex.
