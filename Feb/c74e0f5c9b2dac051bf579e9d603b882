This is in response to the threat earlier made by controversial pro-Biafra agitator, Simon Ekpa, who has been calling on the people of the region to boycott the election.  The Nigeria Police Force has said that nobody can disrupt the conduct of elections in Southeast Nigeria on Saturday. This was stated by John Amadi, the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG) representing the South-East geo-political zone while addressing newsmen on Friday, on the readiness of the Force to ensure peaceful conduct of the poll. He said, “Nobody born of a woman can stop election in this state. We are ready for them. We are ready to ensure free, fair and credible election. That has been the preaching of the Mr President and the Inspector of General of Police. We are to make sure we carry out the mandate of the Inspector General of Police as handed over by the Commander-In-Chief of Armed Forces. “So we want to sound this warning and for parents to warn their wards that everybody, law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear but criminals have something to fear. Law-abiding citizens, we are here to protect you. Go out and cast your vote, nobody will molest you.” “You don’t need to bother yourself about the non-state actors who have been making noise that there would be no election in Biafra land. There is nothing like Biafra land. The southeast part of this country is full part of Nigerian state,” he added. This is in response to the threat earlier made by controversial pro-Biafra agitator, Simon Ekpa, who has been calling on the people of the region to boycott the election. However, the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) said there would be no sit-at-home or election boycott in the region on election days. The group has advised Igbo people to ignore any such calls.
