The survey published by Bloomberg on Friday, 15 days before the February 25 presidential election showed that two-thirds of respondents to the poll indicated that they intend to vote for Obi.  A poll conducted by Premise Data for Bloomberg News has ranked the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the forthcoming general elections, Peter Obi, above Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The survey published by Bloomberg on Friday, 15 days before the February 25 presidential election showed that two-thirds of respondents to the poll indicated that they intend to vote for Obi. According to the report, of the 93% of participants who said they have decided how to vote, 66% named Obi as their preferred choice candidate while 18% indicated they will vote for Tinubu and 10% said they will vote for the former Vice President, Atiku. Obi scored a slightly higher 72% among decided respondents in an earlier Premise poll that was released by Bloomberg in September 2022 when the official election campaign kicked off. The San Francisco-based Premise Data said it polled 2,384 Nigerians from January 26 to February 4, 2023, via a smartphone app and submissions were selected from quotas developed by age, gender and location across the countryâ€™s six geopolitical zones and results were then weighted against the original quotas to ensure national representation. Bloomberg News reports that Alliance for Affordable Internet said that about 44% of Nigerians own smartphones and Premise estimated that the access rate rises to 74% among the voting-age population.
