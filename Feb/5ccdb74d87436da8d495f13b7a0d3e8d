As of 12: 40 pm, electoral officials had yet to arrive at some polling units such as Annunciation Hospital polling unit 2 and Emene Central School, in Enugu East senatorial district.

At Umode in Oruku Ward, Nkanu East Local Government Area of Enugu State, the election was also delayed for long.  The former Minister of Power, Prof. Barth Nnaji, who spoke to our correspondent on the telephone decried that there were problems with INEC BVAS machines in his ward.  According to him, as of 12:55 pm, nobody had been accredited.  "I have not voted and my entire ward is being disenfranchised because of this development," he said.  At the Aku Ward 5 polling unit 7, an electoral officer (EO) and INEC officials were accused of manipulating the BVAS machine to favour PDP candidates.  An observer at the polling unit, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said attempts to video the incident were met with resistance from PDP stakeholders from the polling unit.
