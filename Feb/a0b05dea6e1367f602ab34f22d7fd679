In the letter, Olomu alleged that the violence orchestrated by the opposition affected five wards where elections did not take place but results were collated. The candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Michael Olomu, for the Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal Constituency election in Bayelsa State has written a protest letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, over violence and fraud witnessed on Saturday in the general elections. 
In the letter, Olomu alleged that the violence orchestrated by the opposition affected five wards where elections did not take place but results were collated.  
He said, “That the violence that ensued in ward five (5) Ebedebiri, Ward eleven (11) three (3) and four (4) Ofoni Sagbama Local Government Area; and Ward Twelve (12) in the Ekeremor Local Government Area, actually affected the outcomes of the election in these areas and results generated were forged and as such unacceptable.”  
He also accused the Collation Officer of the Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal constituency, one Dr Omoro Joseph, of announcing forged figures.
“Again the Collation Officer of the Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal constituency, Dr Omoro Joseph, after announcing the conclusion of the election, party agents, security personnel and others reverted on this position and went ahead surreptitiously to announce Mr Fred Agbedi as the winner of that election. 
“Due to the aforementioned, I am urging the Resident Electoral Officer to use his good office to ensure and direct as appropriate, in order to protect the good image of the electoral umpire.”
