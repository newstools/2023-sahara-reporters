SaharaReporters learnt that the baby whose umbilical cord had yet to be severed was rescued by a passer-by who heard her cry from an abandoned toilet at Government Day Secondary School (GDSS), Dumne in the Song Local Government Area of the state. A newborn baby was found alive two days after she was dumped in an abandoned toilet by her father in Adamawa state, Northeast Nigeria.  SaharaReporters learnt that the baby whose umbilical cord had yet to be severed was rescued by a passer-by who heard her cry from an abandoned toilet at Government Day Secondary School (GDSS), Dumne in the Song Local Government Area of the state.  SaharaReporters learnt that the infant was thrown away because her grandmother had forbidden her son from raising a child born by a non-Muslim mother.  As further gathered, the father, Ibrahim Lalle, acting on his mother's instructions wrapped the rejected infant in a polythene bag and dumped her in an abandoned toilet.  The baby's mother, Hande Daniel, a Christian, was reportedly impregnated by Lalle, a Muslim. However, after Daniel had the baby girl at Lalle's house, his mother vehemently protested that it was against the Islamic tenets to raise the child.  "Lalle's mother also rejected the idea of her son contemplating any marital relationship with Daniel because of her religious beliefs," a source said. Meanwhile, Daniel and Lalle's mother have been arrested by the police, while Lalle is at large.  The spokesperson for the Adamawa State police command, SP Suleiman Nguroje confirmed the incident, saying, "The newborn baby was rescued by a good Samaritan and is currently being medically attended to.  "Meanwhile two suspects, the baby's mother and grandmother are in our custody. A manhunt has been launched to apprehend the principal suspect, after which they will be charged to court for the law to take its course."
