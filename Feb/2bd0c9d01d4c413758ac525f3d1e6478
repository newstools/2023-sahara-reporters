The deployment of non-sensitive materials had commenced ahead of the February 25, presidential election. Following the rising insecurity in the South East, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), says it requires about 13,000 security personnel for the general elections in Enugu State. The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Enugu state, Dr Chukwuemeka Chukwu, disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria on Monday. Chukwu noted that the security personnel would be deployed to 4,145 polling units, 260 Registration Area Centres and collation centres across the 17 council of the state. While revealed that security had been beefed up at the commission's local government offices, the REC said that the Inter-agency Consultation Committee on Election Security was working to mobilise and deploy the required number of security personnel to ensure hitch-free elections in the state.  According to him, the deployment of non-sensitive materials had commenced ahead of the February 25, presidential election.  “We are working ahead of the commission’s schedule and ensuring practical proactive implementation of all timelines of INEC in the state.  “We have continued to have constant meetings and engagement with stakeholders to ensure secured, free, fair and credible elections in Enugu state.  “We are ready to ensure that 2023 elections will be the best in the state especially with the use of technology,” he said SaharaReporters had reported that hoodlums labelled as "unknown gunmen" had been attacking and burning INEC offices in various local government area of Enugu State and elsewhere in the South East. Security agencies have pinned the blame on Biafra separatist groups but most especially is the Indigenous People of Biafra, although, the group had denied culpability.
