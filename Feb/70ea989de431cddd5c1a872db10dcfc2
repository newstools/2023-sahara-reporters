A suspected top cartel member accused of leading the region’s production of fentanyl, which has killed thousands in the United States has been arrested by security forces.  Mexico’s defense ministry made this known on Sunday, noting that the arrest was made on Thursday in the state of Sinaloa, according to NBC News.  The arrest came just weeks after President Joe Biden visited Mexico, and followed the recent high-profile arrest of cartel leader Ovidio Guzman.  The suspect is described as being a leading logistics chief for the famed narco trafficker known as “Mayo Zambada,” who jointly headed the powerful Sinaloa cartel.  “It should be noted that the accused is considered the main producer of fentanyl and methamphetamine pills, in addition to carrying out the large-scale transfer of cocaine from Central and South America to the U.S,” the ministry said in a statement.  Following standard procedure in Mexico, it named him as Jose “N,” not giving his full name.
