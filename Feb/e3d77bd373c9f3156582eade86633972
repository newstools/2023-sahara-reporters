More than 3000 people have now been killed and thousands more injured after the catastrophic earthquake that hit the two countries overnight, flattening neighbourhoods while families were asleep.  Ghanaian footballer, Christian Atsu, who was amongst the victims reportedly trapped under rubble after a huge earthquake that hit Turkey in the early hours of Monday has been found alive, according to Mail Online. More than 3000 people have now been killed and thousands more injured after the catastrophic earthquake that hit the two countries overnight, flattening neighbourhoods while families were asleep. A search and rescue operation for the former Chelsea and Newcastle player was launched, and it was widely reported that it was successful. A Bola, a Portuguese news outlet, was the first to report that Atsu had been found, adding that he had been transported to a hospital after suffering injuries to his right foot and breathing difficulties. Several members of his new team had to be rescued after the earthquake and Atsu is now reported to be amongst those still missing as a search and rescue operation gets underway. The club's sporting director, Taner Savut, is also trapped as efforts to free them continue. Atsu joined Chelsea as a youngster in 2013 from Porto before being sent on a number of loan spells. He spent time at Everton and Bournemouth before making a permanent switch to Newcastle United in 2017 having never played a Premier League game for Chelsea. He left the Magpies having played over 100 games in 2021 to join Saudi side Al-Raed but departed the Middle East for Turkey in the summer. He scored his first goal for the club this weekend, just hours before the earthquake struck.
