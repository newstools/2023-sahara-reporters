She said though the monetary and fiscal policies are intertwined in politics, the CBN has completely immersed in itself the politics of the country. Former vice president for the World Bank's Africa region, Dr Oby Ezekwesili has picked holes in the implementation of the monetary policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria on the redesigned naira notes, claiming that the apex bank has lost focus by delving into politics.  Ezekwesili, who spoke while featuring on a Channels TV programme, on Sunday, said though the monetary and fiscal policies are intertwined in politics, the CBN has completely immersed in itself the politics of the country.  The former presidential candidate and education minister questioned if there were economists left in the apex bank, considering its serial failures in monetary policies, especially regarding the redesign of the naira which has paralysed economic and social activities across the country.  The former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), who spoke on various topical issues, said, "You can tell as I said that the monetary policy has become so completely immersed in the politics of our country, which is such a disgrace.  "This is so sad that what is purely technical and we don't kid ourselves to say that there's no element of political context within which monetary policy and fiscal policy happened - more fiscal policy than monetary policy but monetary policy still happened within a political context but not to the extent of what we have seen under President Muhammadu Buhari.  "Frankly speaking I don't know whether there are economists left in the Central Bank of Nigeria because when I look at the serial failure to think through policies even what we call policy timelines and to think through the policies on the bases of evidence that is on the table so that data is helping to drive your decision more than impulse or an attitude, or the whims and caprices of those that you report to and the Central Bank is compromised and it has to be one number one thing on the agenda."
