According to him, the protests will be used as an excuse by some people, believably people in President Muhammadu Buhari’s government, to postpone the elections. The presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prince Adewole Adebayo has warned that there is an agenda to postpone the 2023 general elections and install an interim government in Nigeria.  Adebayo disclosed this in a statement posted on his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday, warning youths not to take part in protests.  According to him, the protests will be used as an excuse by some people, believably people in President Muhammadu Buhari’s government, to postpone the elections.  "Before joining any street protests, think twice. In fact, don't do it. Take it from me, this is what they want you to do so that elections can be postponed and a dastardly "Interim Government" is cobbled up comprising the same clique. I have told them to count me out of it. Never!" he wrote.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that some angry youths in Warri town, Delta State, on Wednesday set fire to branches of Access Bank and Union Bank while protesting against the persisting scarcity of naira notes that had forced many businesses across the country to shut down.  This was captured in viral videos showing angry youths protesting around Udu Road axis, disrupting vehicular movements and destroying valuable properties in the area.  The protest was said to have been caused by the rejection of old naira notes by the banks and their inability to dispense new naira notes.
