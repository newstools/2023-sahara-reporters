Among those killed is a commander of the group, Abu Zara.   In what appeared to be a continuation of their sustained deadly clash, the fighters of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) have attacked Boko Haram members, during which about 15 of them were killed. Among those killed is a commander of the group, Abu Zara. A counter-insurgency expert, Zagazola Makama, disclosed this in a series of tweets on Thursday. According to Makama, the recent rivalry clash occurred in Sambisa Forest. “At about 1740 hrs on 9 February 2023, reports indicates a deadly gun battle between ISWAP and Boko Haram terrorists around Arege, located south of Malam Fatori, with several terrorists killed,” he said. “Prior to the confrontation, there was report that JAS Buduma faction had deployed foot soldiers in the general area, which could have been a prelude to this attack.” The rival terrorist groups have been attacking communities in the Northeast region since both camps fell apart over leadership issues. The groups have also since been having clashes, and Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, was reportedly killed during one of such clashes in 2021.
