A trending video of an unidentified supporter of the Labour Party asking party leaders to release funds to mobilise people for the presidential campaign rally in Lagos State has surfaced online. Former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi is the presidential candidate of the party. One of the party’s slogans is “We don’t give Shishi”. Obi held his final campaign rally in Lagos State on Saturday at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS). In the video, the lady who was angry that the venue of the rally was scanty asked the stakeholders to release funds intended for the mobilisation. “Guys, it’s 11:20AM what and this place is still empty, it’s not allowed guys. We can’t afford to have Lagos empty, you that they gave money to mobilise, start mobilising people they gave you money to mobilise. Don’t come and embarrass us in Lagos. What nonsense, by now, this place should be full,” she said. Earlier, SaharaReporters reported that some supporters of the LP presidential candidate were attacked by hoodlums in Lagos State. Videos and pictures shared on social media also showed some individuals believed to be Obi’s supporters with bruises, as well as vandalised buses and cars purportedly deployed to transport supporters for the various events to be held by the party. Confirming the attack, Lagos police command’s spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin said four persons were injured.
