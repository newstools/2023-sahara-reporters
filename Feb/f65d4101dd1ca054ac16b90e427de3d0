The army said the arrested suspects had been handed over to the police. The Nigerian Army has reportedly intercepted a bus conveying officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), policemen and soldiers who went round a senatorial district in Akwa Ibom State allegedly manipulating results of Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. The army said the arrested suspects had been handed over to the police.
The Akwa Ibom State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko Macdon, confirmed the arrest but said he was not in the mood to speak until all facts had been gathered. 
SaharaReporters during the week reported that the Nigerian Army approved a list of hotlines to monitor and report any suspicious activity or acts of violence by unscrupulous persons or group of persons capable of disrupting the peaceful conduct of the 2023 general elections, as well as the conduct of troops deployed to provide security during the polls.  The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, had disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday.
According to the statement, the action is part of Nigerian Army’s move to support the lead security agency, the police for the successful conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections.
“It could be recalled that the NA had earlier produced and circulated Codes of Conduct and Rules of Engagement for Operation Safe Conduct to formations and Units to provide guidance and ensure that troops operate within the provisions of the codes and rules.
“Members of the general public are please enjoined to call the phone numbers below in their various states including the Federal Capital Territory Abuja to report any security breach during the elections,” the statement read.
