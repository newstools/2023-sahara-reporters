Ulyanov died in a firefight when he was attacked by the Ukrainian sabotage group this week. A sabotage team that reportedly invaded Kyiv, Ukraine capital, have killed a 44-year-old Russian Major-General identified as Dmitry Ulyanov, who had returned to active service after retirement as a commander to fight in Russia-Ukrainian war.  Daily Mail reports that Ulyanov died in a firefight when he was attacked by the Ukrainian sabotage group this week.  Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had raised an alarm that “enemy sabotage groups” have entered the capital Kyiv and called on the public to be careful and follow curfew rules.  A report by Daily Mail on Tuesday said that Ulyanov was a top paratrooper, commander of the elite 98th Guards Airborne Division. He had retired but went to the current war commanding a regiment of mobilised motorised infantrymen from Tatarstan.  Ulyanov’s death means that the Russian President, Vladimir Putin has lost at least 10 such senior commanders since his troops invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
