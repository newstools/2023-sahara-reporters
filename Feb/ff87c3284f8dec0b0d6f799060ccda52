Petrol price is so high And you queue and hiss Thinking when will things get better You even see fuel, But the banks deny you Naira Stop lamentations, A new dawn is knocking On your door of conscience; Freedom is on the ballot  You live in Southern Kaduna, And it's war and want everyday Terrorists makes us sleepless Yet, the government is useless Stop the cries For they cannot bring back our losses March out and vote your conscience For Freedom is yet on the ballot  They say it's a sin to be Igbo And that it's a taboo To demand Biafra They give you unknown Gunmen Instead of bargains of peace Don't mind the vampires Our party believes in self-determination And we call for unconditional release of Mazi, and all other political prisoners Kindly boycott the oppressors And vote true liberty Freedom is on the ballot  They lie that governance is rocket science And you must have all the rogue experiences To even be a councillor Tell them to their wicked faces Bad government is their experience Dirty politics is all they know Impunity is the watchword And all they think is their pockets It's time to do away with evil days Light has come No one will be left behind Freedom is on the ballot  They say Sowore is arrogant For fighting the thieving Elders They say we are so rude For daring to break the rules Which they use to enslave us They say we are exuberant Because we reject primitive roguery Naija youths and people It's time to be rude to the thieves It's time to be arrogant against oppressions It's time to rise and face the future It's time to vote for the majority And not the wishes of minority Freedom, I repeat, is on the ballot.  February 25th is coming No more excuses If we fail again this time By voting one of them destroying us We have failed the next generation They have all the money But now we can choose A bribe to vote suffering Or a rejection to vote Liberty Our ten fingers is the logo To unite , vote, and defend For Freedom is lying patiently On this ballot of history!
