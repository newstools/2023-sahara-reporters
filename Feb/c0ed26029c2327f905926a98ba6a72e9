The meeting would be held at the Main Auditorium, Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Abuja. A group, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), is organising a town hall meeting with the presidential candidates for the February 25, 2023 to discuss Nigeria’s environment and climate change challenges in the context of policy options. The Town Hall Meeting which will hold on February 7, at the University of Abuja, according HOMEF's Director, Nnimmo Basey, in statement issued on Friday, is being organised in collaboration with its partners - We the People, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), and the University of Abuja.  According to the statement, the meeting would be held at the Main Auditorium, Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Abuja. The town hall meeting which over 1,000 participants including civil society, the media, professional organisations, trade unions, students and the academia are expected to attend, will assess and interrogate the plans and policies of the political parties in addressing the myriad of environment and climate crisis bedevilling Nigeria. Basey noted that “while the well-being of the environment is a critical factor in a nation where most citizens depend directly on it for their existence, the issue has not been topical in the election conversation.  “The challenges of climate change in Nigeria have intensified in recent years. Nigeria, being one of the most impacted frontline countries, has seen an accelerated rate of desertification and flooding, twin manifestations that have seriously threatened security, and food sufficiency.  “Similarly, the production of crude oil and gas has resulted in profound destruction of the environment, especially in the Niger Delta. 12 years after the release of the United Nations Environment Programme report on the state of the Ogoni Environment, no significant action has been taken to remediate and curtail further oil pollution in the region.”
