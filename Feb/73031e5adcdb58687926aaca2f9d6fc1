Obasanjo had in a statement on Monday berated INEC over the conduct of the elections, pointing out several reported violence and irregularities recorded during the elections across the country and called for cancellation of the elections in some parts of the country. The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the 2023 general elections, Omoyele Sowore, has said that former President Olusegun Obasanjo has no credibility to talk about fraudulent elections.
Sowore, while reacting to Obasanjo's statement where he (Obasanjo) condemned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the conduct of the Saturday presidential and National Assembly elections, said that Obasanjo organised most fraudulent elections while in office as a president for eight years.
