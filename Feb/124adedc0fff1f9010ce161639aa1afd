The state governor, Dapo Abiodun visited the patient in the hospital where he is being treated on Wednesday, promising to foot his medical bills. A man shot by the police during a protest in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital over the scarcity of fuel and new naira notes is alive and responding well to treatment, SaharaReporters learnt on Wednesday.  The state governor, Dapo Abiodun visited the patient in the hospital where he is being treated on Wednesday, promising to foot his medical bills.  There was a protest at Odo Eran in the Obantoko area of Abeokuta on Tuesday following which trigger-happy policemen opened fire on a group of protesters.  One of the videos obtained by SaharaReporters shows as the bloodied victim who had just been shot held his right hand, staggered as he walked and fell inside a drainage. Some onlookers present quickly rushed to him and helped him up.  Videos also show how a police van drove roughly through the area and how lawless policemen shot into the air as the protesters scampered to safety.  There was apprehension as several shops were deserted while the lawless policemen forcibly dispersed the protesters.  SaharaReporters earlier reported that some angry Nigerians also blocked the Benin-Ore Highway in Ondo State to register their displeasure over the scarcity of naira notes and fuel, which had been ravaging the nation for weeks.  The protest which caused gridlock made travellers plying the route to be stranded.  A cross-section of the protesters attributed their actions to the frustrations being faced in banks and filling stations.  According to videos seen by SaharaReporters, the protesters also defied police presence as they marched on the highway.
