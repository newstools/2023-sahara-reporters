El-Rufai dismissed the LP candidate's chances, saying he (Obi) would not win the presidential election.  The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has stated that one local government area’s votes will cancel the votes of Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi in Anambra State. Obi, a two-term governor of Anambra, is counting on votes from his home state in the election. However, in a TVC interview, El-Rufai dismissed the LP candidate's chances, saying he (Obi) would not win the presidential election. He said, “Peter Obi win election? Peter Obi is polling one per cent in Sokoto, two per cent in Katsina, five per cent in Kano, this is how the votes are; all states are not equal. “The fact that you are doing 70 per cent in Anambra State does not mean somebody doing 10 per cent in Kano is not better than you. “Kano is 4 million votes that actually happened, Anambra is what, the number of votes in Anambra is the size of one local government in Kaduna State. “So all states are not equal, yes Peter Obi will sweep southern states, he will do well in south south, where else? “He is not polling well in the south west other than a drop of ocean in Lagos, he is polling in Christian enclaves in the north, he is polling well but how many are they? How many? “Peter Obi can’t win the election, he doesn’t have the number of states, he doesn’t have 25 per cent in more than 16 states, he can’t go anywhere. Peter Obi is a Nollywood actor and that’s all he will be. “This election is between the APC and the PDP because they have the footprint, they have the spread. Ethnicity and religious bigotry will not take you anywhere and that’s what the Labour Party can be.”
