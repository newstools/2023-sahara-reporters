Mr Peter Obi is the candidate of the Labour Party for the presidential election while Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso is the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party. A female corps member and presiding officer in Saturday's presidential and National Assembly elections have been caught manipulating and changing the election result of the Labour Party presidential candidate at a polling unit to favour the New Nigeria Peoples Party candidate.  Mr Peter Obi is the candidate of the Labour Party for the presidential election while Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso is the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party.  SaharaReporters gathered that the incident happened in one of the polling units in Abakpa Ward, Enugu East local government area of Enugu State, Southeast Nigeria. A viral video seen by SaharaReporters on Sunday shows the female member of the National Youth Service Corps female who presided over the polling unit begging people. She claimed that all the corps members from northern Nigeria participating in the election in the Southeast region were told to do the same.  In the video, a result sheet was seen showing mutilated vote scores of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Obi.  When LP party agents caught her, she said, "I am aware of the full consequences of my action and I am ready to take any punishment. I am sorry, this is what I was told to do."  A text that accompanied the video read, "Corper caught at Abakpa stealing Peter Obi's vote and transferring same to Kwankwaso."
