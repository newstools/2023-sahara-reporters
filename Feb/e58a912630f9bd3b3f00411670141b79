"It happened that my daughter attend CHRISLAND HIGH SCHOOL And it was their inter-house sport event yesterday (Thursday 9TH, FEB 2023) and she dressed up from home, healthy with no health conditions or sickness at all, the school bus came to pick her up to the venue of the event at Agege stadium, so my wife alter dressed up and went to attend the event, when she get there she noticed she didn't see her daughter in the midst of the student that's matching or partaking in the activities then she begin to look for her, asking the students and teachers about her and then she noticed a gathering of students surrounding themselves like something is going on so she walk towards the place to asked about her daughter but while she was walking down to the place she noticed the school bus took speed out of the school and she was still complaining that why will the bus speed out like that where there are many students, but when she get there and show a student her daughter's picture that she's looking for her then the student said she's the one that's been rushed out now in the school bus, then she had to quickly locate a teacher and asked what happened and she was told she slumped, she called me immediately and told me they said my daughter slumped and they've taken her to the hospital that I should be coming right away while she head to the hospital, while getting to where they took her to, it's an health center, their excuse was because of traffic to get to the hospital they had to take her to health center and they told my wife that our daughter is dead, got there myself and I was asking questions they couldn't answer me, because I saw her body down, the eyes, lips and face is already dark in less than an hour, then I faced the nurse that they called while she was still in school to check her, I asked her what happened she said to be sincere by the time she gets to the school she's already dead but she couldn't pronounce her dead because she's not a doctor that's why she allowed them to bring her to the health center first and since then I've been asking Chrisland school to tell me what happened to my daughter, but they are saying they don't know, she just slumped and died, Ahhhhh please come to my aid, this need to be the last time Chrisland staffs will kill a child because of their negligence and incompetence, I paid heavily in this school and they couldn't get a first aid on stand by for their inter-house or pay proper attention to the students.  "Justice For Whitney Adeniran."  The mother of the deceased girl, in a video, lamented that Whitney "was not taken to a hospital, she was taken to an immunisation centre".  "But that is not even my pain, my pain is that there was no proper first aid management, there was no proper management, there was nothing that was done for her; she was brought to the hospital dead," she said.
