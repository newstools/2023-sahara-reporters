The governor accordingly directly attacked the NGOs and alleged that their activities during last Saturday's elections amounted to vote-buying in the state. The governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Fintiri, has accused foreign and local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) of meddling in the 2023 presidential and National Assembly elections.  The governor accordingly directly attacked the NGOs and alleged that their activities during last Saturday's elections amounted to vote-buying in the state.  Governor Fintiri, therefore, suspended their activities in the state until after the March 11 Governorship and House of Assembly elections.  "It has been discovered that most non-governmental organisations have swallowed the bug and are dabbling into politics in the name of providing humanitarian assistance to the people.  "Government cannot fold its arms and watch such so-called NGOs mislead the people and inject divisive tendencies into their psyche.  "In view of the foregoing and in furtherance of our desire to reorder the electoral behaviour of our people and remove the influence of the NGOs who have reduced the statutory mandate to that one of a vote-buying machine, government has decided to suspend the activities of local and international non-governmental organisations throughout the state until 15th of March, 2023, when the elections are done.  "This is done in good faith and in furtherance of our desire to deepen our democracy and protect the humanitarian mandate of the NGOs," Governor Fintiri said.  The governor expressed gratitude for the peaceful conduct of the 2023 presidential and National Assembly elections.
