   The people loved Fela the fighter but rejected him and his Movement of the People at the polls. The people liked Gani Fawehinmi, the fighter and rejected him at the elections under the National Conscience Party NCP. The people liked Tunji Braithwaite as a fighter and rejected him at the polls under Nigeria Advanced Party NAP. The people love Wole Soyinka the fighter but rejected Wole Soyinka the leader, when he ran for election under his de-registered political party, Democratic Front for a People's Federation DFPF. The people love Femi Falana the fighter, but rejected Femi Falana the leader when he ran for Ekiti Governor under NCP. The people now love Sowore the fighter but don't want Sowore the leader. The people simply prefer crooks till date. If the fighters do not join the party of the crooks and crooked, they are told they aren't ready to lead. Until they join the gathering of sleaze, they are considered unelectable. But tomorrow, I will go and vote Sowore. I have my voters' card and Sowore has my vote. I trust him both as a fighter and as a leader. Yours sincerely,
Citizen Agba Jalingo.
