It was reported on Sunday that Pastor Aigbe mounted the pulpit during the second service, which frequently has a high turnout of the congregation who come from different parts of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The Nigeria Police Force has vowed to investigate the case of the presiding pastor of the Abuja chapter of the House on the Rock, Pastor Uche Aigbe, who caused a stir on Sunday when he mounted the pulpit carrying an AK-47 rifle.  It was reported on Sunday that Pastor Aigbe mounted the pulpit during the second service, which frequently has a high turnout of the congregation who come from different parts of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.  The Punch reported that while brandishing the gun, the cleric went to the altar as many members of his congregation exchanged glances, trying to understand what was happening. Pastor Aigbe who was reportedly visibly aware of apprehension on the faces of his congregation was quoted as saying, “Some people are looking for my trouble. And I came here prepared.  “Today, there are some pastors with the gift of divination who go about ripping people. This is why we should carry our ‘guns’ and defend ourselves. I will particularly be coming very soon for some of you sleeping in the church.”  Reacting to the incident, the Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Prince Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the pastor has a case to answer as his action falls under prohibited firearms in Nigeria, as no one is allowed to bear AK-47 except an officer.  Adejobi said, “But if it's true, the pastor will have a case to answer. AK47??. It falls under prohibited Firearms in Nigeria, and no one bears it except an officer of the law, and not all of them have the right, selected sec operatives, but no individual has the right to bear it.  “The FCT police command will investigate it. I trust the new CP FCT, CP Sadiq,.. it's shocking.”
