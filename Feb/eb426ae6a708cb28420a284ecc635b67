SaharaReporters gathered that several people including teenagers were reportedly shot and macheted on Wednesday during a campaign rally of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the area. Emewe-Opada in Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State, North Central Nigeria has been thrown into turmoil as political thugs allegedly working for the council chairman, Prince Ishiaqa Okolo have reportedly unleashed mayhem on members of the opposition political parties in the area. SaharaReporters gathered that several people including teenagers were reportedly shot and macheted on Wednesday during a campaign rally of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the area. Several pictures and video footage seen by SaharaReporters on Thursday evening show people with machete cuts on their heads and teenagers bloodied after being shot.        Sources told SaharaReporters that the attackers were led by the All Progressives Congress Youth Leader in the Dekina Local Government Area, who was reportedly executing the directive of the APC House of Representatives candidate for Dekina/ Bassa, Hon. Paul Haruna Gowon aka IJN. The massive violence unleashed on opposition party members also occurred in Abocho community, in the same local government area. A source said, "Apart from those earlier attacked and injured, another teenager also sustained a gunshot injury in the same Abocho in a mass shooting at PDP candidate supporters headed by the APC Dekina local youth leader. "The youth leader issued a threat in the company of Senator Jibrin Isah Echocho, a senator representing Kogi East. "Dekina local government area remains politically volatile. We have recorded so many uninvestigated deaths in this same local government since Prince Ishiaqa Okolo was made the local government chairman because he wants to show Governor Yahaya Bello that APC is in control and capable of delivering the local government to APC. â€œThe worse part of it is the conspicuous silence of the security agencies in this regard. If it was to be opposition party members that are causing the violence, the police and other security agencies would have descended heavily on them."
