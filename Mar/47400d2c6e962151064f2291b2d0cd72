Soludo, who is also a former CBN Governor, hence enjoined Anambra residents not to reject the old Naira notes but to freely accept and use same. The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has stated that the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, confirmed to him personally that the commercial banks had been directed to dispense old currency notes and to also receive same as deposits from customers. Soludo, who is also a former CBN Governor, hence enjoined Anambra residents not to reject the old Naira notes but to freely accept and use same. The Anambra Governor said tellers at the commercial banks are to generate the codes for deposits and there is no limit to the number of times an individual or company can make deposits. Soludo said the CBN Governor gave the directive at a Bankers’ Committee meeting held on Sunday, 12th March, 2023, Daily Trust reports. “The Governor, Dr Godwin Emefiele, personally confirmed the above to me during a phone conversation on Sunday night. Residents of Anambra are therefore advised to freely accept and transact their businesses with the old currency notes (N200; N500; and N1,000) as well as the new notes,” Soludo added. He called on residents to report any bank that refuses to accept deposits of the old notes. “Anambra State Government will not only report such a bank to the CBN, but will also immediately shut down the defaulting branch.” Checks by Daily Trust with the CBN to independently confirm the claim proved abortive as the spokesman, Isa Abdulmumin, could not be reached. Sources at the Apex bank noted that there have been several virtual meetings between Emefiele and the bank chiefs leading up to Sunday evening and there are strong indication that the news is true. The CBN has at the time of this story has not debunked the claim of Governor Soludo.
