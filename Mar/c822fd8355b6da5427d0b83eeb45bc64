The incident occurred at about 9 am near the CBN Bus Stop in Enugu, when an 18-seater bus with Enugu registration number, XL884 ENU collided with a haulage truck carrying bags of cement. Tragedy struck in Enugu, Southeast Nigeria on Thursday as at least eight persons reportedly lost their lives in a motor accident along Enugu-Onitsha Expressway.  The incident occurred at about 9 am near the CBN Bus Stop in Enugu, when an 18-seater bus with Enugu registration number, XL884 ENU collided with a haulage truck carrying bags of cement.  Eyewitnesses said the two vehicles were driving in one lane because of the potholes dotting the other lane.  One of the eyewitnesses, Ifeanyi Ejike, who spoke to journalists at the scene of the accident said the bus loaded commuters from Abakpa, in Enugu East local government area and was heading to New Market when the accident occurred.  “The driver whose name we have learnt is Simeon was coming from Abakpa and made attempt to overtake another vehicle in his front that was emitting too much smoke from its exhaust pipe.  “As he made attempt to overtake the vehicle, the trailer was very close and the next thing we heard was a loud sound and the bus was completely damaged. I don’t know how many survived but I counted eight dead bodies on the floor," he said.  Many others attributed the avoidable crash to the poor state of the road which many motorists have capitalised on to engage in wrong-way driving.  The police, army and road safety personnel were on the ground to control traffic and avoid any breakdown of law and order on Thursday.  Meanwhile, victims and the remains of the dead persons have been taken to Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, ESUT-Parklane.
