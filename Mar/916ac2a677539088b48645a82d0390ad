The blast tore through the Taliban governor's office, police said. Taliban's Governor and two others have been killed in a blast in his office in northern Balkh province in Afghanistan on Thursday.  The blast tore through the Taliban governor's office, police said.  "Today around 9am a blast took place inside the second floor of the governor's office, due to the blast (governor) Mawlawi Mohammad Dawood Muzamil has been killed with two civilians," said Mohammed Asif Waziri, Balkh's police spokesperson.  He said police were investigating and would provide more details once they became clear, according to Reuters.  The cause of the blast was not immediately known.  Mohammad Dawood Muzammil is one of the highest-ranking Taliban officials to be killed in such a circumstance since the group took over Afghanistan in 2021. Muzammil was initially appointed as the governor of the eastern province of Nangarhar where he led the fight against Islamic State before he was moved to Balkh last year.  Muzammil's death comes a day after he met two deputy prime ministers and other senior officials visiting Balkh to review a major irrigation project in northern Afghanistan, a government statement said, according to a report by AFP.  Violence across Afghanistan has dramatically reduced since the Taliban came to power. However, the security situation in the war-torn country has again deteriorated with the Islamic State claiming several deadly attacks.  Several attacks have rocked the Balkh province, some claimed by the Islamic State. In December last year, a roadside bomb killed seven petroleum company employees aboard a bus in Mazar-i-Sharif city of the province. Also in December, 19 people were killed and 24 injured by a blast at a madrassa in Aybak, southeast of the city.
