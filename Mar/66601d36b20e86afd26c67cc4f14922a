Obi, a former Governor of Anambra State, had said he would prove to Nigerians that he won the presidential election.  A former Minister of Aviation and member of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council,, Femi Fani-Kayode has tackled the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, for insisting that he is the winner of Saturday’s poll. Obi, a former Governor of Anambra State, had said he would prove to Nigerians that he won the presidential election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Wednesday, declared Bola Tinubu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the winner of the presidential poll. Tinubu secured 8,794,726 votes while Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had the second-highest figure with 6,984,52 and Obi polled 6,101,533 votes. Addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, Obi, however, said he would explore all legal avenues to recover his mandate While responding to Obi’s claim, Mr Fani Kayode described him as a delusional person for holding such a view, saying: “Peter the Pooh says he won the election? Wonders never cease! Now I know where the Obidients get their mass delusion & hypnotic psychosis from. Can someone tell this poor, lost soul to stop shedding tears on nat. television. He can leave that to Dati the Daft: he is good at it.” He added: “Obidients in Lagos are not only delusional but they also suffer from hubristic pride which will lead to their nemisis in the gubernatorial election on March 11. They remind me of a figure in Greek mythology called Icarus whose wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. “As for the PDP in Lagos under the leadership of that morbid pest, motor park tout & vainglorious thug called Jandor, it is as dead as a dodo. The APC WILL be victorious in Lagos in the Governorship elections because @jidesanwoolu has done a great job over the last 4 years.”
