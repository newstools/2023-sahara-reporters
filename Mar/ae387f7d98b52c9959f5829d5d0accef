In an exclusive interview with Sunday PUNCH, George said Tinubu has been claiming that he is from Lagos but it is not true. He urged Tinubu to say the truth and tell Nigerians that he is from Iragbiji in the Boripe Local Government Area of Osun State. Former Military governor of Ondo State and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bode George, has asked the president-elect and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, to tell Nigerians and the world the truth about his state of origin and other backgrounds.  In an exclusive interview with Sunday PUNCH, George said Tinubu has been claiming that he is from Lagos but it is not true. He urged Tinubu to say the truth and tell Nigerians that he is from Iragbiji in the Boripe Local Government Area of Osun State. There have been controversies surrounding Tinubu ranging from issues regarding questionable wealth, ill health, allegations of certificate forgery and corruption, bagman to drug (heroin) traffickers, money laundering ring investigation and place of origin.  On the outcome of the 2023 presidential election in which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) winner and president-elect, the interviewer said, “The winner, Tinubu, is from your state and the presidency of Nigeria is a lot of work, have you congratulated him or will you still do it?”  In his response, George said, “He is not from my state. He should now come clean because he is from Iragbiji in Osun State. Tell the truth and let the devil be ashamed. He is claiming Lagos but that is not true.  “The battle is still long. If Yakubu had gone through the process and as enacted by the law and he turns out to be the winner, we would have congratulated him.”
