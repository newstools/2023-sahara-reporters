A United States Professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University, Steve Hanke, has tackled President Muhammadu Buhari for his satisfaction with the outcome of the February 25th presidential election, which saw Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) emerge victorious.  Hanke, a vocal critic of Buhari's administration, stated this on his verified Twitter page, chastising the Nigerian President for ignoring the country's socioeconomic problems to focus on conducting a poll that did not reflect the people's true will.  He said, “Nigeria ranked THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD when it comes to safety and security according to @CatoInstitute’s 2022 human freedom index. Instead of paying attention to the safety of his people, Pres. Buhari is focused on more important things such as staging a FLAWED ELECTION.  “#NigeriaWatch: Under Pres. Buhari, human freedom in Nigeria has gone from bad to worse. Buhari’s most recent blunder was his blessing of a flawed Presidential election in which his man Bola Tinubu, was declared the winner.”  The 2023 Nigerian presidential election was held on February 25, 2023, to elect Nigeria's president and vice president. Bola Tinubu, the former Governor of Lagos State and the All Progressives Congress nominee, won the election with 36.61% of the vote, totalling 8,794,726 votes.  Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and former Governor of Anambra State Peter Obi of the Labour Party finished second and third respectively. The final result was announced on March 1, but Abubakar and Obi immediately challenged it.  Other federal elections, including those for the House of Representatives and the Senate, were conducted on the same day, while state elections will take place on March 11.  The inauguration of the new President is set for May 29, 2023
