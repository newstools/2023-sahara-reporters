A former aspirant at the All Progressives Congress’ presidential primary that produced Bola Tinubu as the party's flag bearer, Tein Jack-Rich, has congratulated the president-elect and his running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima, over their victory at the 2023 presidential polls.
Jack-Rich, an oil businessman and philanthropist, expressed optimism that Tinubu and Shettima presidency would usher in a new dawn for Nigeria and promote inclusiveness in governance for national good. 
In a short statement on Saturday, the former APC aspirant said the country needed to build bridges and shun actions that could tear the country apart. 
“Now is the time to build bridges for the good of the country and not plot to tear it apart,” he added. 
“Tinubu and Shettima presidency will usher in a new dawn for Nigeria and promote inclusivity in governance for national good. Tinubu will preside over a peaceful and prosperous Nigeria given his enviable track record of hard work, devotion and dedication to duties,” he noted. 
During the APC presidential primary, Jack-Rich was however one of those who in a joint statement issued by Ogbonnaya Onu on their behalf distanced themselves from the purported list of five choice candidates.
According to them, the motive of the APC governors who came up with the list, including the name of Tinubu, was in their personal selfish interests, and not for the Southern region.
