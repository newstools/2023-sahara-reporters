“Those at the helm of affairs in Rivers State when our presidential mandate was openly stolen in Rivers State should step aside until a full investigation into what occurred on that day," he said. Julius Abure, the Labour Party's National Chairman, has dissolved the party's State Executive Council in Rivers State over alleged anti-party activities and corruption in the management of the party's funds. “Those at the helm of affairs in Rivers State when our presidential mandate was openly stolen in Rivers State should step aside until a full investigation into what occurred on that day," he said. Abure questioned the ability of the State Executive Council, led by Deinye Pepple, to lead the campaign for the March 11 governorship and State House of Assembly elections. He urged all Obidients (supporters of Labour Party and its presidential candidate, Peter Obi) in the state to ignore Pepple's remarks and actions. According to Abure, Beatrice Itubo is still the Labour Party's candidate for the state's governorship election on Saturday. In addition, the chairman stated that the Labour Party has not formed an alliance with any other political party. Hours earlier, Pepple endorsed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Siminialayi Fubara, for Saturday's election, saying he is supporting a young and vibrant candidate from the state's South-East Senatorial District, which has yet to produce a governor.
