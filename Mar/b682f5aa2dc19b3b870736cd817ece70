The three leading presidential candidates won in 12 states each while Kwankwaso claimed only Kano State. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, as the president-elect. This is amid protests by the Labour Party and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and calls from various quarters that the results of the elections be cancelled going by irregularities around the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS). Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, was declared the president-elect after the 70-year-old polled 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election. The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, announced Tinubu as the winner at the International Collation Centre in Abuja during the early hours of Wednesday. Tinubu won the election ahead of other contenders â€” the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar; the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi; and the New Nigeria Peoples Party candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso. The three leading presidential candidates won in 12 states each while Kwankwaso claimed only Kano State. Tinubu edged Atiku, a former vice president and his closest challenger, with no fewer than 1.8 million votes.
