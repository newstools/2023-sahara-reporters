Buhari gave the advice in a congratulatory message to the president-elect, Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate in the election, admitted that there were “technical problems” with electronic transmission of results. President Muhammadu Buhari has advised those who lost the February 25 presidential election conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission to take up the matter in courts if they can prove the fraud they claimed was committed but not to the streets. 
Buhari gave the advice in a congratulatory message to the president-elect, Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate in the election, admitted that there were “technical problems” with electronic transmission of results.
The INEC on Wednesday declared Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress winner of the election. 
He defeated main challengers Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Peter Obi of the Labour Party.
“I know some politicians and candidates may not agree with this view. That too is fine. If any candidate believes they can prove the fraud they claim is committed against them, then bring forward the evidence. If they cannot, then we must conclude that the election was indeed the people’s will – no matter how hard that may be for the losers to accept. If they feel the need to challenge, please take it to the courts, not to the streets.
“However, to do the latter means they are not doing it in the interest of the people, but rather to inflame, to put people in harm’s way and all for personal, selfish gains," Buhari said.
President Buhari while pledging to work with him to ensure smooth transition, described Tinubu as the best man for the job.
“The election was Africa’s largest democratic exercise. In a region that has undergone backsliding and military coups in recent years, this election demonstrates democracy’s continued relevance and capability to deliver for the people it serves.
“Within Nigeria, the results reveal democracy’s ripening in our country. Never has the electoral map shifted so drastically in one cycle. In the presidential elections, states in all regions across the nation changed colour. Some amongst you may have noticed my home state amongst them. “The winning candidate did not carry his own home state either. That happens during a competitive election. Votes and those that cast them cannot be taken for granted. Each must be earned. Competition is good for our democracy. There is no doubt the people’s decision has been rendered in the results we look at today. “That is not to say the exercise was without fault. For instance, there were technical problems with electronic transmission of the results. Of course, there will be areas that need work to bring further transparency and credibility to the voting procedure. However, none of the issues registered represent a challenge to the freeness and fairness of the elections." He however added, “After a degree of polarisation that necessarily accompanies any election, it is now time to come together and act responsibly. I call on all candidates to remember the peace pledge they signed just days before the election. Do not undermine the credibility of INEC. Let us now move forward as one. The people have spoken.”
