Atiku who spoke for the first on the elections stated this while addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja.  The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has described the just concluded general elections as a “rape of democracy” just as he vowed to challenge the outcome of the elections in the court of law. He faulted the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, for hurriedly announcing the results and declaring Bola Tinubu as the winner despite alleged irregularities that characterised the conduct of the election. Atiku who spoke for the first on the elections stated this while addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja. Atiku said "I can still not understand why the electoral umpire was such in a hurry to conclude collation and announcement of the results, giving the number of complaints and irregularities of bypassing of BVAS, failure of uploading to INEC Results Viewing Portal (IReV) and unprecedented cancellation and disenfranchisement of millions of voters in breach of the Electoral Act and Commission's own guidelines. It was indeed a rape of democracy. "Having consulted with the leaders of our party and Nigerians of different walks of life, I have come to the conclusion with processes and outcome that the Presidential and National Assembly elections last Saturday were grossly flawed in every material in particular and must be challenged."
