The former Deputy National Chairman of PDP, Chief Bode George had in January said he would go away from Nigeria, when asked whether he would go on exile if Tinubu emerged as the President of Nigeria.  A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Bode George, has vowed to retire from partisan politics following the emergence of Bola Tinubu as Nigeria’s president-elect. The former Deputy National Chairman of PDP, Chief Bode George had in January said he would go away from Nigeria, when asked whether he would go on exile if Tinubu emerged as the President of Nigeria. "I will move away from Nigeria, I’ll leave because he will be your representative in the international plain. Which investment will he bring here? I am not talking because I have any hatred for him. This is not the kind of person we can hand over this massive country to manage. He will be the greatest joke on the international plane. We should bother who should lead us.” However, the one-time military governor of Ondo State while featuring on Arise News on Thursday, said he would retire from active politics after the governorship election on March 11. George who lamented over the presidential election that produced Tinubu, accused the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu of not living up to his promises of ensuring a free and fair election. He urged Yakubu to allow the will of the people to prevail during the governorship election. He said; “I have decided to retire from partisan politics after the governorship election, and I can decide to go and live anywhere. I want a peaceful life for myself.” “I know this fellow (Tinubu) and he’s not for them. If he had gone through the process, I would have congratulated him. You can’t go through darkness to get to light. I can go and live anywhere, it can be Ghana, Togo, or still remain in Nigeria,” he added.
