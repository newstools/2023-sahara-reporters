Rhodes-Vivour said the party was in talks with the ‘real owners’ of PDP in Lagos to form an alliance ahead of the state governorship election.  The Labour Party says it has begun alliance talks with the Peoples Democratic Party to defeat the ruling All Progressives Congress and its candidate, Babajide Sanwo-Olu in the March 11 governorship election in the state. The governorship candidate of the party in the state, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour disclosed this while addressing journalists on Wednesday. Although a former governor of Lagos and the candidate of the APC in last Saturday’s presidential election, Bola Tinubu has been declared as the winner of the election and president-elect, he lost to the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, in Lagos. Rhodes-Vivour said the party was in talks with the ‘real owners’ of PDP in Lagos to form an alliance ahead of the state governorship election. “We are talking with the real owners of the structure of PDP and in the next coming days, we are going to come into alliance with them,” he said. He expressed optimism about defeating the APC and emerging as the next governor of the state. “People are going to come out more than they did the last time,” he added.
