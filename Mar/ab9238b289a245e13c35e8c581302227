This comes less than 72 hours before the March 11, 2023 governorship election. The Federal High Court sitting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, has dismissed a suit seeking to disqualify the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori, as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Saturday's election.  This comes less than 72 hours before the March 11, 2023 governorship election.  In the suit marked FHC/ASB/CS/3/23, a PDP governorship aspirant Ikie Agharianovwe sought to disqualify Oborevwori on grounds that he allegedly presented false documents and prevented the party from having a candidate in the election.  The suit has the PDP as the first defendant, Oborevwori as the second defendant and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the third defendant.  Delivering judgment on Wednesday, the court presided over by Justice Folashade Olubanjo dismissed the suit for what he described as an abuse of court process and being statute barred.  Justice Olubanjo also held that the suit has no reasonable cause of action, pointing out that it lacked merit as the plaintiff was unable to prove allegations of presentation of false documents by the first defendant on behalf of the second defendant to the third defendant.  Since the emergence of Oborevwori as the PDP governorship candidate for the governorship election, there has been one suit or another filed to challenge his emergence.  The most celebrated was the suit filed by the former governorship aspirant and former commissioner for finance, Davies Edevbie against Oborevwori when the Supreme Court finally affirmed him as the authentic governorship candidate of the party.
