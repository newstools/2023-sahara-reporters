Aderinto, a professor of History and African Diaspora Studies at Florida International University, is the first Nigerian to win the prize. The presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi, has deleted his tweet hailing the US-based Nigerian professor, who won the Dan David history prize of $300,000, Saheed Aderinto. Aderinto, a professor of History and African Diaspora Studies at Florida International University, is the first Nigerian to win the prize. SaharaReporters had reported how Obi attached a photograph of a lecturer in the department of Sociology, University of Ibadan, Professor Abideen Aderinto, to the congratulatory message. Apparently embarrassed, the LP presidential candidate deleted the tweet and replaced it with another. Attached to the new tweet is the original picture of Professor Saheed, who was among the nine scholars who clinched the award considered the largest history prize in the world. Obi said, “Today, I celebrate and felicitate with our Nigerian born Prof Saheed Aderinto, a Professor of History and African Diaspora Studies at Florida International University, who recently won the $300,000 Dan David Prize—the largest history prize in the world. “Prof Aderinto is the First and only Nigerian to have been awarded such prestigious prize in recognition of his outstanding scholarship in the very important field of history. “Beyond his financial reward, I am particularly thrilled by the achievements of intellectual giants like him who place Nigeria on the global map. As a firm promoter of education for societal development, I hope that his scholarly works will deepen our understanding of history and help sharpen our views for a better tomorrow. -PO”
