Justice Emmanuel Agim, who read the lead judgment, written by Justice Uwani Abba-Aji, faulted the appeal by the INEC and thereafter dismissed it. The Supreme Court has sacked Senator Ibrahim Shekarau while affirming the nomination of Senator Rufaâ€™i Hanga as the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) candidate for Kano Central Senatorial District in the February 25, 2023 National Assembly election.  A five-member panel of the Supreme Court, led by Justice Inyang Okoro, on Friday in a unanimous judgment faulted the refusal by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to replace Shekarau with Hanga after Shekarau defected from the party to join the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before the election, The Nation reports.  Delivering the ruling, Justice Emmanuel Agim, who read the lead judgment, written by Justice Uwani Abba-Aji, faulted the appeal by the INEC and thereafter dismissed it.  The apex court affirmed the two earlier concurrent judgments by the Federal High Court and the Court of Appeal which recognised Hanga as the authentic candidate of the NNPP.
