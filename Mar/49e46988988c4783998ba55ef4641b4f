SaharaReporters earlier reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, as the president-elect. A Certificate of return will be presented to the President-elect, Bola Tinubu, and vice president-elect, Kashim Shettima, on Wednesday, the Independent National Electoral Commission has disclosed.
SaharaReporters earlier reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, as the president-elect.
This is amid protests by the Labour Party and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and calls from various quarters that the results of the elections be cancelled going by irregularities around the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS).
Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, was declared the president-elect after the 70-year-old polled 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election.
The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, announced Tinubu as the winner at the International Collation Centre in Abuja during the early hours of Wednesday.
Declaring Tinubu as the winner, the INEC boss said, “That Tinubu Bola Ahmed of the APC, having satisfied the requirements of the law is hereby declared the winner and returned elected.”
After announcing Tinubu as the winner, Yakubu explained that the commission would be presenting the certificate of return to Tinubu and Shettima at the International Collation Centre in Abuja.
The move, he said, would allow the commission to have ample time to adequately plan for the governorship election billed for March 11.
He said though Tinubu and Shettima would be getting their CoR, senators and House of Representatives members-elect would have to wait a bit.
"The commission would issue a statement later today on when the ceremony for senators and House of Representatives members-elect would hold," Yakubu stated.
