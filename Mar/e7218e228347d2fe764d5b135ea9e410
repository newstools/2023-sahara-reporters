The governor is said to have directed Ozumba to hand over all necessary documents to the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Productivity immediately. The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, has sacked the Commissioner for Labour and Productivity, Ford Ozumba. The Commissioner for Information, Declan Emelumba, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday. Emelumba said the removal was with immediate effect. The governor is said to have directed Ozumba to hand over all necessary documents to the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Productivity immediately. Sources said no reason was given for the sack but it may not be unconnected with the ongoing impasse between the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) led by Joe Ajaero and the Imo State Government. Ajaero had accused officials of the Uzodimma Government on Tuesday of disrupting its state congress and unleashing mayhem on workers exercising their rights to elect their leaders. He had also declared the unionâ€™s indefinite industrial action in the state. The strike caused a lot of controversies with the Imo State traders last Friday, staging a protest in front of the Imo government house. They had warned the National Chairman that the traders were ready to face him squarely to stop the strike in the state and that due to the power outage, they were now facing more economic challenges in the state.
