The police sergeant had died Saturday at Bankole’s house located at Kemta Housing Estate, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The Nigeria Police Force has ordered an autopsy on the remains of a police sergeant, Gbenga Onakomaya, who was found dead at the residence of the former Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, Lanre Bankole.
The police sergeant had died Saturday at Bankole’s house located at Kemta Housing Estate, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
It was gathered that the cop, who was on guard duty at the former Commissioner of Police’s house, slept but could not wake up in the morning.
He was reportedly rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta, where he was pronounced dead by the doctor on duty.
Bankole handed over to the former Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, on 10 February.
The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, deployed Bankole to head the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) X-Squad at its Annex in Lagos State.
While he was away, police officers were on guard at his residence.
However, the Ogun State Police command spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the development said it was a case of “natural death” adding that an autopsy would be carried out to unravel what caused the death. 
“A police officer was on duty; he slept and couldn’t wake up in the morning. It is a case of sudden death. It is not something that is beyond the ordinary. It is not something that has not happened before. Anybody can be sick and die anywhere, even in your house, somebody can be sick and can die anywhere.
“The police have ordered an autopsy to unravel whatever that might have caused the death.”
