He described the claim as cheap blackmail, propaganda and fake news by the Zamfara State Government with a view to tarnishing his image.  The Zamfara State governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dauda Lawal, has reacted to a viral video where he was allegedly cited with the wife of a North-West Governor in London. He described the claim as cheap blackmail, propaganda and fake news by the Zamfara State Government with a view to tarnishing his image. He disclosed this in a statement on Sunday in Gusau, through the Dauda Lawal Media Office, adding that the All Progressives Congress government had lost focus due to his overwhelming popularity across the state. He referred to the video as mischief cooked by the Zamfara State government aimed at tarnishing his image. He also urged his supporters to direct their energy on the project to salvage Zamfara from the mismanagement of the Matawalle-led administration. He said, "This is another step that shows how far the enemies of the people are willing to go. By the grace of the Almighty Allah, my wife Huriyya will be the wife of a Governor of a North West State in Nigeria and I, her husband, will deliver on the yearnings and aspirations of our people. “I appeal to our dear people to be aware that other fake news like this will be deployed in the coming days. We must resist these vile actions of people in power who cannot put this level of energy into good governance for the benefit of the people. “By the grace of the Almighty Allah, their time in power will soon be at an end. “I appeal to all lovers of democracy, respect for the rule of law, and respect for family values to come out in large numbers to vote for PDP so we can actualize our vision for the development of our people."
