A former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose said Obi had not made enough inroads into Northern Nigeria.  Yunusa Tanko, the spokesman for the Obi/Datti Baba-Ahmed Presidential Campaign Council has boasted that the Labour Party controls the social media and the Nigerian youths.  Peter Obi and Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed were the presidential candidate and vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party in Saturday’s election.  But the election was won by Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, who polled 8,794,726 votes.  Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party came second with 6,984,520 votes while Obi came third with 6,101,533 votes.  During an interview on Arise TV News on Wednesday evening, Tanko reiterated the position of the party that it would challenge Tinubu’s victory in court.  Meanwhile, earlier on the station, a former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose said Obi had not made enough inroads into Northern Nigeria.  Reacting to Fayose’s statement, Tanko said, “That is the story they start with; they told everybody that we are only on social media. Today, after that particular social media advocacy, we moved to physical being on the streets.  “We moved from there now to be allotted 12 states of the federation of Nigeria, which we know we won more than that. We were allotted 12 states within how many months  yet we are controlling the social media and we are controlling the Nigerian youths. So, anybody who is talking and still under the illusion that we are not firmly on ground, I think he has something upcoming.”  He urged all supporters of Obi, who are known as Obidients, not to lose hope, insisting that the matter will be challenged in court.
