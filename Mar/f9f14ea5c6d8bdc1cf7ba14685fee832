Governor, who is the running mate to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in the 2023 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, who expressed fears about the closure of the church in the Presidential Villa, called on Christians to pray that God's purpose would be done. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has said that it is not God's will that the Chapel in Aso Rock Villa in Abuja should be replaced with Muslim-Muslim leaders as president and vice president.  Governor, who is the running mate to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in the 2023 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, who expressed fears about the closure of the church in the Presidential Villa, called on Christians to pray that God's purpose would be done.  The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Governor Okowa said this while speaking on Friday at a meeting with Isoko Church Leaders held at God’s Fountain of Life Mission in Oleh, Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State.  Okowa's statement comes after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) - a Southern Muslim and his running mate, Kashima Shettima - a Northern Muslim, president and vice president-elect of the February 25, 2023 presidential election.  Governor Okowa said that the Saturday’s presidential and national assembly was compromised, saying that the outcome of the election “is not the will of God”.  According to him, the opposition “saw the manipulation coming and prayed against the situation in which we have found ourselves”.  “It is not the will of God that the Chapel in Aso Rock will be closed for four years as a result of the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC.”  He therefore encouraged Christians to “continue to pray” so that God’s purpose “will be done in our state and in Nigeria,” adding that it is time to “rise in faith and not time to mourn”, urging the faithful to “be prayerful and to think from inside”.
