SaharaReporters had on Saturday reported that some gunmen invaded the estate, opposite Champions Church, around 10pm on Friday and shot sporadically before making away with several victims. The victims had included a pastor, whose name had yet to be ascertained, his wife and three children, totalling no fewer than 15 persons during the one-hour assault. SaharaReporters had learnt that the gunmen made away with the victims through the forests at about 11pm but gunshots from the vigilantes forced them to allow about seven persons to escape. SaharaReporters had observed that policemen from the Byzahin division and the Kubwa Area Command visited the scene for preliminary findings and interrogated some of the victims. On Monday, a top source close to the families said the gunmen had got across and demanded for N50million ransom. “Yes, they have called in. They called in on Sunday and demanded for N50million ransom. One or two persons have been released but 11 persons are still with them. We believe the police and other security agencies are also working underneath to secure their release,” the source stated.
