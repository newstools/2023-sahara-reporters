Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and the vice presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party in the last Saturday's presidential and National Assembly elections had earlier raised fear that the chapel would be closed for four years due to the Muslim Muslim ticket. Femi Fani-Kayode, one of the spokespersons of the Presidential Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress has dispelled the fears that the Aso Rock chapel will be closed for four years.
Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and the vice presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party in the last Saturday's presidential and National Assembly elections had earlier raised fear that the chapel would be closed for four years due to the Muslim Muslim ticket.
SaharaReporters had reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission declared Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress winner of the last Saturday's presidential election.
Tinubu, a Muslim from South West ran the election with Kashim Shettima, another Muslim from the Northern region of Nigeria. 
Raising the fear on Saturday, Okowa had said the Muslim-Muslim presidency was not God’s will for Nigeria. “It is not the will of God that the Chapel in Aso Rock will be closed for four years as a result of the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC,” Okowa had said. However, Fani- Kayode in a swift reaction took to his Twitter handle to diffuse the fears, insisting that the chapel would not be closed, because the wife of the President-elect, Oluremi Tinubu was a pastor. The former Minister of Aviation wrote: “The assertion that the Aso Rock Chapel will be shut down for four years because @officialABAT and @KashimSM, the President-elect & Vice President-elect respectively, are Muslims is absurd given the fact that the in-coming First Lady is not only a Christian but also a Pastor.” https://twitter.com/realFFK/status/1631920694647717888?t=Rix1oUhCVB9xcF1RPT_jBA&s=19
