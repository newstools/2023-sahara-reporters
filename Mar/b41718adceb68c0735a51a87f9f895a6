Professor Ibrahim Adamu Yakasai, the Returning Officer for the election, announced this on Wednesday. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared that there was no winner in the February 25 National Assembly election in Doguwa and Tudunwada federal constituencies.  Professor Ibrahim Adamu Yakasai, the Returning Officer for the election, announced this on Wednesday.  Alhassan Doguwa, Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, who contested on the All Progressives Congress (APC), was initially declared as the winner of the election.  But the lawmaker has since been arrested for being allegedly responsible for the violence experienced during the election.  INEC later questioned Doguwa’s re-election following Doguwa’s arrest.  The lawmaker has been charged and arraigned on charges of murder allegedly committed on Election Day. He was subsequently remanded in prison and granted N500 million bail by the court.  Two people were killed and the secretariat of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) was set ablaze during the violence that broke out in the constituency.  Meanwhile, the electoral commission has delisted his name from the names of House of Representatives members-elect and failed to issue him a certificate of return.
