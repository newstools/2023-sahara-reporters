The police in statement, said the 56-year-old Degamo and some civilians were hospitalised with unspecified injuries. Some unidentified gunmen reportedly shot dead a provincial Governor of Negros Oriental, in the central Philippines, Roel Degamo, and five other people on Saturday.  The police in statement, said the 56-year-old Degamo and some civilians were hospitalised with unspecified injuries.  According to a police statement, the governor was shot in his residence in Pamplona town, AFP reports.  The police spokesperson, Kym Lopez, said several gunmen entered Degamo's residence and opened fire as the 56-year-old politician was distributing aid to constituents.  Degamo is at least the third politician to be shot since the local elections last year. The Philippines has a long history of attacks on politicians.  Philippines President, Ferdinand Marcos, condemned what he described as the "assassination" of his political ally Degamo, and vowed to bring swift justice to his killers.  In February, the Supreme Court declared Degamo the rightful winner of the contest for the Negros Oriental governorship following a recount that unseated his local rival, who previously proclaimed victory.  Also last month, two other politicians were attacked in the country. Mamintal Adiong, governor of the southern province of Lanao del Sur, was shot and wounded in an attack that killed his driver and three police escorts.  Rommel Alameda, the vice-mayor of the northern town of Aparri, and five other people who were travelling with him were shot dead in a highway ambush. The police identified the registered owner of a car used by the assailants in the ambush.  According to a report by the Philippine Star on February 22, the police had the name of the owner of the Mitsubishi Adventure, which was found burned in Solano town.
