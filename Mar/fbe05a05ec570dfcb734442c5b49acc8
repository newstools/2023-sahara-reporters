Nigeria’s population is estimated to be about 216 million according to the UN population agency, UNFPA.  According to Daily Trust, a staff member of the commission, who does not want his name in print as the decision is yet to be taken said that the exercise would now hold between May 3 to 7.  “The census will hold now from May 3 to 7 and it is a recommendation that has been submitted to the President. He is going to approve it anyway but it is yet to be decided.”  The Chairman of the commission, Nasir Isa Kwarra, had given a hint of the shift of the exercise Thursday while receiving some digital items from the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) in Abuja.  Kwarra, while stating that the decision has not been reached, said President Muhammadu Buhari would decide the next line of action.  He applauded UNFPA for its support and partnership.
