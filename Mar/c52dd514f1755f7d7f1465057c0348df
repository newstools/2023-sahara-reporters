The Court of Appeal in Abuja had on March 3 granted the request of Obi and Atiku to have access to all the sensitive materials INEC deployed for the conduct of the presidential election held on February 25.
The applicants urged the court to compel INEC to allow them to obtain documents in its custody that were used for the presidential election.
They maintained that the requested documents would aid their petition against the outcome of the presidential contest that was declared in favour of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.
INEC is asking the Presidential Election Petition Court to vary the orders which were earlier granted.  
In a motion on notice filed on March 4, the electoral body is praying to the court to vary the order which restrained it from tampering with materials used for the election.
The commission said it needed to reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for the next round of elections.
The Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC) has listed some motions for hearing this afternoon.
However, INEC on Tuesday listed the filed motion for hearing.
INEC also listed the motions filed on March 6 by the President-elect, Bola Tinubu and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) for an order to inspect materials used for the last presidential election.
Further listed for hearing is a motion by Obi and LP “for leave to carry out a digital forensic and physical inspection of BVAS, etc.”
