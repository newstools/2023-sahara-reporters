The Central Bank of Nigeria has said a report alleging that its Governor, Godwin Emefiele has launched a fresh plot against President-elect, Bola Tinubu is not true. A report published on Monday had alleged that Emefiele released N500 million in new bank notes to shore up the campaign of the Lagos State, Labour Party Governorship candidate, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour. CBN in a statement signed by the Acting Director Corporate Communications, Isa Abdulmumin said the story was malicious as Emefiele did not know and had never met or spoken with Rhodes-Vivour in person or through proxy. “We wish to inform members of the public that this story is completely false and malicious as the Governor does not know and has never met or even spoke with Mr Gbadebo Rhodes Vivour either in person or through proxy. “We wish to reiterate that the CBN Governor does not take part in Politics and therefore urge anyone with contrary information to prove the Governor wrong should provide such facts,” the statement read in part. “As such the CBN said its Governor and team at the apex banking sector regulator should be allowed to focus on their assigned job with a view to achieving the statutory mandates of the Bank.” Emefiele has been silent since the judgment of Supreme Court on the Naira redesign policy, with many Nigerians counting their losses on daily basis following the cash crunch ravaging the country.
