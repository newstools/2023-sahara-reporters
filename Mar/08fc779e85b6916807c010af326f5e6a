The Brigade Commander, 9 Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Brig. Gen. Isang Akpaumontia, disclosed this on Wednesday while parading the suspects and the recovered PVCs, ballot papers and other incriminating items at Ikeja Cantonment. The Nigerian Army says it will hand over to its immediate headquarters three persons caught with 1,671 permanent voter cards in an apartment in the Olodi-Apapa suburb of Lagos, Southwest Nigeria.  The Brigade Commander, 9 Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Brig. Gen. Isang Akpaumontia, disclosed this on Wednesday while parading the suspects and the recovered PVCs, ballot papers and other incriminating items at Ikeja Cantonment.  Disclosing how the suspects were tracked and arrested, Akpaumontia said the arrest and recovery were made following a tip-off. He, however, added that the prime suspect was on the run.  According to him, the majority of the recovered PVCs were registered in 2022 as the registration number, while others were registered in 2011, 2012 and 2021. Information gathered shows all the owners are residents of Lagos State, according to him.  “Earlier today (yesterday), three young men were arrested with 1,671 PVCs.  This was after early information was received. With the support of the Department of State Services, DSS, we were able to arrest them.  “They were arrested with some drugs, dagger, charms and over 1,000 PVCs. They were arrested at the Apapa general area, in a house where we traced them to. The owner of the house, who is the prime suspect, was traced to a hotel. But he took off.  “We are going to hand these suspects and exhibits over to our immediate headquarters to do the needful because things have to be done the way they should, so as to discourage others who think they can take laws into their hands and go scot-free.”
