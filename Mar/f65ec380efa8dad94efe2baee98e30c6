Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, was declared the president-elect after he polled 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election The All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council (APC-PCC) has urged Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, and his Labour Party counterpart, Peter Obi, to emulate the former President Goodluck Jonathan and concede defeat.
The Independent National Electoral Commission has declared the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, as the president-elect.
Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, was declared the president-elect after he polled 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election.
The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, announced Tinubu as the winner at the International Collation Centre in Abuja during the early hours of Wednesday.
The APC council spoke through Dele Alake, the special adviser, media and communications, at a press conference in Abuja.
He said, “In 2015, President Jonathan did not wait for INEC to finish collation before he called President Muhammadu Buhari and congratulated him in the true spirit of democracy and sportsmanship.
“We urge Atiku Abubakar and Obi to follow the same path of honour, instead of attempting to heat the polity via the reckless statements by surrogates.”
Former President Olusegun Obasanjo was chastised by Alake for essentially calling for the cancellation of last Saturday's presidential and National Assembly elections.
