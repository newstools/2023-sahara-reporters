ENetSuD had defeated the Kwara State Government at both the high and appeal courts, which unanimously held that the appointment of TIC by the governor for the 16 local government areas are illegal, and ordered the governor to conduct election for the council areas immediately. A civil society organization in Nigeria that promotes good governance, transparency and accountability, Elites Network for Sustainable Development (ENetSuD) has filed a motion at the Supreme Court in Abuja to seek the relief of the court for an order to strike out the appeal brought by the Governor, Government, and Attorney General of Kwara State on the judgement relating to the illegal appointment of Transition Implementation Committee (TIC) and refusal to conduct Local Government (LG) election in Kwara State.  ENetSuD had defeated the Kwara State Government at both the high and appeal courts, which unanimously held that the appointment of TIC by the governor for the 16 local government areas are illegal, and ordered the governor to conduct election for the council areas immediately.  However, the governor failed to comply with the judgements of both the high and appeal courts, but proceeded to the Supreme Court as the court of last instance, a statement issued on Wednesday by Saeed Tijjani, Press Secretary, ENetSuD, said.  The government served ENetSuD with the records of appeal since June 15, 2022 but failed to file and serve ENetSuD with the brief of arguments within 10 weeks as stipulated in the rules of the Supreme Court.  ENetSuD told the Supreme Court that the Kwara State Government had failed to comply with the rules after 30 weeks of filing its appeal.  ENetSuD concluded that the “Government of Kwara State is not willing to diligently prosecute the appeal, but only filed the appeal to prevent execution and compliance with the judgements of the High and Appeal Courts that order the Governor to sack the illegal TICs and conduct LG election for Kwarans to democratically elect people into the 16 Local Government Councils as stipulated in the Constitution of Nigeria”.
