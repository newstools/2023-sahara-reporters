SaharaReporters had reported how the cash crunch has been biting hard nationwide, including in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT.
The cleric said, “And that largely depends on the accessibility of cash in and out flow of individuals and organisations and that is essential in the world of business. Keeping that spirit even after Ramadan is very crucial to the growth and development of your business.
“I would like to use this medium to call on the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria to release more cash to the country as Ramadan is fast approaching.
“People are in utmost need of money for Ramadan expenses and other activities. May Allah make it easier for all of us, Ameen.”
