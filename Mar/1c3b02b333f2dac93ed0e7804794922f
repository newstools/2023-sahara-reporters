Vanguard on Wednesday reported that security operatives arrested Irona at his Owerri residence at about 10:15 a.m. Former Deputy Governor of Imo State, Gerald Irona, was on Thursday remanded in prison by a Magistrates’ Court sitting in Owerri, the state capital.  Vanguard on Wednesday reported that security operatives arrested Irona at his Owerri residence at about 10:15 a.m.  An eyewitness was quoted as saying that some security operatives from “Imo State police command have arrested the former deputy governor of Imo state, from his house in Owerri”.  “They came to his house dressed in black attire. They took him to the State police command and they said his arrest was based on the order from the above. He is now detained at the Imo state police command.  “His offence was because he made a statement that Imo state will be made ungovernable during that Supreme Court battle between Governor Hope Uzodinma and former Governor Emeka Ihedioha if Ihedioha was removed from office.  “And that Irona had earlier been declared wanted by the police for unlawful possession of government properties among other offences,” the eyewitness said.  On Thursday, the presiding Magistrate, C. N. Ezerioha, after hearing the prosecution counsel and defence counsel, ordered that Irona be remanded in Owerri correctional centre.  The Magistrate reportedly held that the court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain the matter.
