This was according to a statement made available to newsmen by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, while condoling with traders who lost their goods during the incident.
SaharaReporters had reported that some suspected political thugs burnt down the market.
SaharaReporters had gathered that the hoodlums stormed the market around 2am on Wednesday and shot a security guard and two other persons before razing down the market's facilities.
During his visit to the market on Thursday, the governor urged Lagosians to refrain from attributing the unfortunate incident to any political party or its agents, claiming that those seeking political advantage from the incident were being devious.
The statement reads: “Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has commiserated with the traders who lost their goods in the Akere Spare Parts Market in Ajegunle.
“He is shocked by the incident. Mr Governor, on behalf of the government, genuinely shares their grief. He has ordered a probe into the fire, which emergency workers have put out.
“Besides, Mr Governor implores Lagosians to desist from attributing the unfortunate incident to any political party or its agents. Those who are struggling to make political gains from the incident are being mischievous.
“It is shameful to take advantage of the misfortune of others to feather some political nests.”
