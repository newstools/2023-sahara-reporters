The organisation which gave the warning in a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, also asked the former Lagos State governor not to victimise other sections of the country that did not vote him during the election.  The Igbo apex socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has warned the President-elect, Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) against victimising the Igbos who did not vote for him during the February 25, 2023 presidential election.  The organisation which gave the warning in a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, also asked the former Lagos State governor not to victimise other sections of the country that did not vote him during the election.  He urged him to consider Igbos in the distribution of amenities.  Isiguzoro said, “Ndigbo urges the President-elect not to victimise any section of the country who voted against him but as the new Political leader of the Country, he should ensure that Nigerians, especially Ndigbo are accommodated in the distribution of public amenities and provide an enabling environment for businesses to thrive in the country.”  Meanwhile, the Igbo apex socio-political organization also retracted its earlier stance on the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and asked Igbos in the state to vote their conscience in the March 11 governorship elections.  Ohanaeze however asked Governor Sanwo-Olu to provide adequate security across all markets in the State for Igbos and other residents of the state during the election.
