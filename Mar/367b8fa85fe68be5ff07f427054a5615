Ikpeazu issued the threat on Thursday during a town hall meeting with the workers at the International Conference Centre, Umuahia. Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has threatened that there will be sanctions against civil servants if they fail to vote for the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, Okechukwu Ahiwe, in the March 18 election.  According to the News Agency of Nigeria, Ikpeazu issued the threat on Thursday during a town hall meeting with the workers at the International Conference Centre, Umuahia.  He warned that there would be “consequences” for their “indiscretion”.  The governor claimed that the state government under his watch had come up with several policies and programmes that would improve the welfare of workers.  “On March 18, you must vote for continuity because if you gamble with your future, you have also put your job on the line. I owe it to you as a duty to remind you of the consequences of your indiscretion as you elect the next governor,” the Abia governor stated.  “I have directed that between now and seven days that the leave allowance of civil servants be paid.  “Even as I grant command promotion to everyone, its implementation will be easier if you vote for the governorship candidate of PDP, Chief Okey Ahiwe.”  The governor described civil servants were integral to achieving the infrastructure development recorded during his tenure.
