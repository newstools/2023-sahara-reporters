Speaking with SaharaReporters on the phone on Saturday, the NNPP candidate, Adeleke Ojetunde, lamented that he lost in the election because the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) exchanged the original NNPP logo his party sent to the commission with a blurred logo without the party name on the ballot paper. The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) candidate for Ogbomoso North/South/Oriire Federal Constituency in Oyo State in the February 25, 2023 election has called for the cancellation of the election results in the constituency over blurred logo of his party on the ballot paper.  Speaking with SaharaReporters on the phone on Saturday, the NNPP candidate, Adeleke Ojetunde, lamented that he lost in the election because the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) exchanged the original NNPP logo his party sent to the commission with a blurred logo without the party name on the ballot paper.  Ojetunde said that “The missing party name on the ballot paper affected my results in the election. Most of our local people are semi illiterate who have it in their mind to vote for the NNPP, in the ballot paper, the proper logo of the party is missing and many of our people could not vote.  “As a Reps candidate, I am calling for the cancellation of the election results in Ogbomoso North/South/Oriire Federal Constituency by INEC.”  Ojetunde told SaharaReporters that he did not notice the error until the day of the election when he went to his polling unit to cast his vote.  He added that he had, however, made an official complaint to the Oyo State office of the INEC but he has not received any response.
