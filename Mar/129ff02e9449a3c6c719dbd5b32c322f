A High Court sitting in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, has ruled against the expelled governorship candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC, Akwa Ibom State, Mr Iboro Otu. According to the court, it cannot assume jurisdiction on a case that involved the internal arrangement of a political party as “activities of a political party are regulated by its constitution.” It added that it could not meddle with the actions of the party in respect of expulsion of its candidate. The court added that if it was a pre-election matter, involving irregularities in primaries, then the court could assume jurisdiction.
