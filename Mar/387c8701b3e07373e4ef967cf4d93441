The alleged decrease in the petroleum production may be unconnected to surge in pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft incidents in its oil-producing region, a development that worsened the country’s revenue challenge. An analysis published by BudgIT, Nigerian civic-tech organisation, has revealed how the Nigerian government lost $74million every day in 2022 due to the decrease in crude oil output under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. The alleged decrease in the petroleum production may be unconnected to surge in pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft incidents in its oil-producing region, a development that worsened the country’s revenue challenge. The report reads: “Did you know that in 2022, Nigeria lost roughly $74m daily due to decreased crude output? “FG predicted daily crude oil production of 1.88m barrels, but the nation only produced a daily average of 1.14m barrels, resulting in a loss of 740,000 bpd at an average price of $100 pb. “While daily production peaked in January at 1.39m barrels and dipped to 937,766 barrels in September of 2022, overall crude oil output dropped from its 2020 high of 546.52m to a 2022 low of 417.20m.” 📌 Did you know that in 2022, Nigeria lost roughly $74m daily due to decreased crude output?

Despite the government's repeated claims that it had enough petroleum products on hand, the scarcity has persisted, despite the country's poor electricity supply. The Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, (MOMAN), therefore attributed the lingering fuel scarcity in the country to high costs of vessels and inadequate trucks to deliver petroleum products from depots to filling stations across Nigeria. The marketers explained that these high logistics and exchange rate costs continue to put pressure on their operations with ripple effects on the pump price.
