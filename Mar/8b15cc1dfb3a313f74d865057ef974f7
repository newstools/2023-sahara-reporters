Speaking at his first press conference on Thursday in Abuja after Saturday’s elections, Obi who came third with a total of 6,101,533 votes, according to the results announced by the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said he won the election and that it was manipulated by the electoral umpire. The Presidential Election Court (PEC) in Abuja has been asked by the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP), Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi respectively to grant them permission to inspect materials used for the February 25 election.  Speaking at his first press conference on Thursday in Abuja after Saturday’s elections, Obi who came third with a total of 6,101,533 votes, according to the results announced by the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said he won the election and that it was manipulated by the electoral umpire.  The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, on the other hand, described the general elections as a “rape of democracy” just as he vowed to challenge the outcome of the elections in the court of law.  He faulted the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, for hurriedly announcing the results and declaring Bola Tinubu as the winner despite alleged irregularities that characterised the conduct of the election.  However, both parties asked the Presidential Election Court (PEC) to allow them to inspect materials used for the election.  The request is contained in two ex-parte motions they filed at the PEC secretariat at the Court of Appeal, Abuja. While Atiku filed his own on March 1, Obi’s motion was filed the next day.  Meanwhile, both motions, with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and two others as respondents, have been listed for hearing today.
