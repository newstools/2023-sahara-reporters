This was contained in a statement released by the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, on Tuesday. The Nigeria Police Force has banned the use and open display of dogs and other pets by electorates at polling units during elections. This was contained in a statement released by the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, on Tuesday. Adejobi said such actions contradict the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 and other laws of the country. The police, therefore, urged Nigerians to comply with the directive to avoid cases of harassment and intimidation during the conduct of elections in the country. The statement reads: “The Nigeria Police Force has deemed it necessary to educate and caution Nigerians on the use of pets, especially, dogs, at the polling units on election day, as such act runs contrary to the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022, as amended. “The provision of Section 126 (1) of the Electoral Act. 2022, explains clearly those actions exhibited by electorates that constitute electoral breaches and are punishable under the law, and paragraph (f) mentions possession of weapons calculated to intimidate voters and electoral officers. Dogs could be classed as offensive weapons as their owners/handlers can use them to intimidate, harass and cause assault and bodily harm to others. “The Dogs Act, CAP 55 Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1958 as domesticated in various States, and other Criminal Laws in Nigeria are trite. “The conceived ideas and plans by certain individuals, electorates, and groups of people to go to the polls accompanied by pets are unacceptable, stand discouraged, and remain an act of electoral infraction as it will cause harassment and intimidation. “The Nigeria Police Force, therefore, warns those who intend to display their pets, dogs specifically, for whatever purpose, at the polling units, to desist as such constitutes a violation of the electoral Act, 2022, as amended, and other extant laws.”
