Sowore urged them to reflect on the vital roles they play in society, homes, governance, and professions. The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, has extolled Nigerian women on the occasion of International Women’s Day, March 8, 2022. First observed in 1911, the IWD is marked yearly on March 8 to draw attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights and violence, and abuse against women. Addressing a gathering of women in a video posted on his Facebook page, Sowore urged them to reflect on the vital roles they play in society, homes, governance, and professions. He said, “Sometimes, I wonder why women refused to come out when you need them most, even though you people are the most courageous, you are the ones who attend political rallies first, you are the last to leave but you always vote for men. “It’s not an indictment but I think there should be more consciousness on the side of women because you have the numbers. When I went to vote in 2019, the first 20 people in my front were women; the next five, they were women. “Everything that goes wrong in our society affects women first and affects them last. War affects women first and affects them last but you guys have one luck that you should not take for granted. These days, I don’t know, you guys are living longer than men, I don’t know what you are eating. “So, if the world is going to be meant for you, you better make it a better world.” “If women are living longer so, please make the country a better country because you are the one to enjoy it the most because you live longer,” he added.
