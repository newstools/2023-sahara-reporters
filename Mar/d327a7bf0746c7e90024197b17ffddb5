SaharaReporters reported penultimate Sunday that no fewer than 50 people gruesomely killed in six communities in the Kwande Local Government Area during Fulani herdsmen’s invasion. Residents of Edikwu-Oiji community in the Apa local government area of Benue State, North Central Nigeria have fled their community following the resurgence of Fulani herdsmen’s attacks. SaharaReporters reported penultimate Sunday that no fewer than 50 people gruesomely killed in six communities in the Kwande Local Government Area during Fulani herdsmen’s invasion. It had been reported that the affected communities in the four-day attack are Adam, Iyarinwa, Abamde Ityuluv, Waya Boagundu, Agura Ayaga and Azege areas in Turan Council Ward, Kwande LGA. However, some of the Edikwu-Oiji residents, who spoke to journalists on Monday, narrated how the herders came in numbers with dangerous weapons and surrounded the whole community. While lamenting the ugly situation, the residents claimed that their farm produce were being destroyed while the remaining portion was used by the herdsmen to feed their cattle. A resident who preferred anonymity said the terrorists warned the displaced people never to step their feet on the farm, “The entire community had been living in fear and apprehension. "Many of the residents had begun to relocate from the community following the Fulani herdsmen’s attack. “The security situation is overstretched and no sign of intervention from any quarter as we speak. The whole community is helpless to contend with armed Fulani herdsmen, lives and properties remain precarious and every other normal activity is being crippled. This is worrisome, are we not Nigerians any longer...? “We want to appeal to the Federal and state government to come to our aid; we need serious presence of security agencies in this community," he pleaded. Meanwhile efforts to get the reaction of the Benue State government and the police were unsuccessful at the time of filing this report.
