According to Associated Press, nobody was injured in the early morning attack, and it was unclear why assailants would target Messi or the Unico supermarket in the country’s third-largest city of Rosario, owned by the family of his wife, Antonella Roccuzzo. Some gunmen left a threatening note for Argentina football superstar Lionel Messi at a supermarket owned by his in-laws in Argentina on Thursday, firing several shots at the entrance of the store. According to Associated Press, nobody was injured in the early morning attack, and it was unclear why assailants would target Messi or the Unico supermarket in the country’s third-largest city of Rosario, owned by the family of his wife, Antonella Roccuzzo. The city’s mayor, Pablo Javkin, went to the supermarket and lashed out at federal authorities over what he called their failure to curb a surge in drug-related violence in Rosario, located about 190 miles (300 km) northwest of the capital of Buenos Aires. Police said two men on a motorcycle fired at least a dozen shots into a Unico branch in the early hours, leaving a message on cardboard that read, “Messi, we’re waiting for you. Javkin is also a drug trafficker, so he won’t take care of you.” Messi has not commented. Considered by his fans as the greatest footballer of all time, Messi is revered in Argentina, especially since he led the national team to the country’s first World Cup victory in 36 years in Qatar in December.  Messi currently plays for Paris Saint-Germain and spends much of his time overseas, though he often visits Rosario where he has a home in the suburb of Funes.
