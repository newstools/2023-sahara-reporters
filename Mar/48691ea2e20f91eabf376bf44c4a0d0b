I encourage the new President to champion #WomenLeaders in his government and to ensure that the rights of women & girls remain a priority,” she had posted. Her comment however did not go down well with Nigerians who trooped to her comment section to tackle her for congratulating Tinubu on his victory in the just concluded election.
