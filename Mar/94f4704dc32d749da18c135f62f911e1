The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, gave the warning at the close of Thursday’s plenary. Owing to the breach of the constitution and Electoral Act 2022 provisions and its guidelines in the conduct of the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections, the Nigerian Senate has told the Independent National Electoral Commission to abide by those laws in the conduct of the March 11 governorship and state Houses of Assembly polls.  The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, gave the warning at the close of Thursday’s plenary.  Lawan, who also suspended plenary till March 14 to enable senators to participate in the campaigns and elections, advised INEC to consider all issues raised by the public about last Saturday’s elections and make necessary adjustments.  He said, “INEC should consider looking into issues raised by the public. INEC should be strictly guided by the Constitution and the Electoral Act and their guidelines and regulations.  “Nigerians should support INEC in whatever way they can so that it conducts the governorship and states assembly elections successfully. This is because that is what we all expect and that is what we need as a democracy.  “We will be out of this place for the next two weeks and come back and continue our legislative functions.”  The Senate President thanked his colleagues “for doing everything possible to make this 9th Senate a success.”
