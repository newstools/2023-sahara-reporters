The police officer allegedly shot Badapba on his shoulder after he predicted APC's victory  in the forthcoming gubernatorial contest.  A trigger-happy Nigerian police officer, Solomon Damak, has allegedly shot a man who predicted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will emerge victorious in Saturday's gubernatorial election in Plateau State. The victim, one Nyommena Badapba, a resident of Tudun Wada community in the Jos North Local Government Area, took the bullet during a hot argument with Damak over which party would win the Plateau state governorship race. The police officer allegedly shot Badapba on his shoulder after he predicted APC's victory in the forthcoming gubernatorial contest on Sunday. As gathered by SaharaReporters, the victim is currently receiving treatment at Bingham University Teaching Hospital, Jos. Spokesperson for Plateau Police Command, DSP Alabo Alfred, has confirmed the incident. “The circumstance that led to the infliction of the gun injury by the recalcitrant officer does not fit into his professional calling but was done out of vindictiveness which contradicts the attributes of a Nigerian police officer. “In order to ensure that the officer does not evade justice, the officer had been arrested, his firearm was recovered and he has since been detained for disciplinary action," Alabo confirmed.
