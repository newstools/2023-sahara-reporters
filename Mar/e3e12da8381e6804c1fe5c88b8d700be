The lawyer revealed that a particular doctor with the DSS who first diagnosed the speedy depreciation in Kanu’s potassium level was sacked recently by the agency, for daring to make accurate findings. Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lead counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has again emphasised that Kanu's health condition had deteriorated to the extent that he currently needs the “urgent service of a cardiologist.” 
The lawyer revealed that a particular doctor with the DSS who first diagnosed the speedy depreciation in Kanu’s potassium level was sacked recently by the agency, for daring to make accurate findings. 
Ejiofor, while giving an update on his routine visit to Kanu in the Department of State Services (DSS) custody in Abuja on Monday, in a statement said that Kanu lamented that his health had been made worse by trial-and-error medical experiment being carried out on him by other in-house unqualified doctors brought by the DSS.
Ejiofor stated that “The visit also provided us an opportunity to further find out Onyendu’s present health status.
“Onyendu, who looked visibly frail, once again narrated to me how his body has been turned into “trial and error experiment” by the quack in-house medical practitioners recruited by the DSS who ostensibly know next to nothing about Onyendu’s peculiar health condition.
“Onyendu was emphatic that he is in dire need of the service of a cardiologist for a comprehensive medical examination.
“Onyendu lamented that one particular doctor with the DSS who first diagnosed the speedy depreciation in his potassium level was sacked early last year by the vindictive agency, for daring to make such profound findings.
“It is on this note that we are calling on the Federal Government of Nigeria to immediately release Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from the custody of the DSS, in line with the unambiguous order of the Court of Appeal which discharged him and forbade his further detention.”
