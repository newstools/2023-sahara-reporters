It is the first time the former Vice President will speak to the public or address a press conference after losing the 2023 presidential election.  The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has said his party is open to forming an alliance with Labour Party's Peter Obi. Atiku disclosed this while addressing journalists on Thursday. It is the first time the former Vice President will speak to the public or address a press conference after losing the 2023 presidential election. According to Atiku, Obi left the PDP because he (Obi) was scared of the governors, adding that the LP candidate was in a rush and nothing could have stopped him (Obi) from being his (Atiku) running mate. He said, “Before the election, governors of the PDP had a meeting and said they must produce the president among them, they must produce the vice President among them, they must produce the chief of staff among them. “Peter Obi got scared and left, I did not get scared. I stood up against the governor. When we formed the PDP, some of them perhaps were in secondary schools or universities. “Peter was in a hurry. He got scared of the governors threatening that they must win the primaries so he left. If indeed he stayed back, he’d have been my VP. I was ready to fight the governors to have him as my VP as I did in 2019.”
