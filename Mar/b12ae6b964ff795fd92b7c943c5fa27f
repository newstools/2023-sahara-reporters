No fewer than 560 members of the Boko Haram insurgents including top commanders, fighters and abductees have surrendered to the military. In what appeared to be a continuation of their sustained inter-rivalry clash, the fighters of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) have attacked members of the outlawed Boko Haram insurgents in Gezuwa camp – one of the terrorists’ dreaded enclaves in the Bama Local Government Area of Borno State, during which about 200 of them were killed. No fewer than 560 members of the Boko Haram insurgents including top commanders, fighters and abductees have surrendered to the military. Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert disclosed this in a series of tweets. Makama said the ISWAP fighters had targeted hundreds of Boko Haram members and their families while they were fleeing from attacks. He said the Boko Haram fighters fled to Gwoza, Konduga, Mafa, Dikwa, Gajiram, and Lake Chad shores. The expert quoted a military source familiar with the development as saying that the ISWAP fighters intercepted the fleeing Boko Haram elements at Choliye village where 200 of them – including their women and children — were killed. “In Yale, a village in Konduga LGA, ISWAP Commander Modu Bashir Okocha led another team of ISWAP to attack another Boko Haram position, and as a result, killed 15 of them, seizing their weapons and motorcycles,” the source said. “The fierce onslaught had forced hundreds of the Boko Haram fighters and their families to surrender to the troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Mafa, Konduga, and other parts of the Theatre while some of them managed to flee through Mafa to Dikwa, Abadam, as well as the Niger Republic in the Lake Chad region. “Some of the fighters escaped to the camp of Bakura Wulgo, aka Abou Oumaymah, in the axis of Marte and Krenowa while others ran to the Mandara Mountains in Gwoza to seek refuge and protection from Ali Ngulde.”
