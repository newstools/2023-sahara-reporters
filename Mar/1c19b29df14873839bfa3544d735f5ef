The Nigeria Police Force, Ogun State Command, on Tuesday arraigned a 33-year-old Point of Sale (POS) operator identified as Ayoola Seun, before an Ota Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding a company, Monie Point, of the sum of N891,000.
Seun was arraigned by the prosecutor, Inspector E.O Adaraloye, who told the court that the suspect committed the crime on October 20, 2022 around 10am at No. 5, Fatimilola St. Afobaje, Itele, Awori, Ota in Ogun State.
According to a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report, the prosecutor said that the Monie Point International gave the suspect the sum of N891,000 to pay some customers but he failed to disburse the money as directed.
Addressing the court, Adaraloye said, “The defendant fraudulently converted the sum of N891,000 to personal use instead of fulfilling the agreement between him and the company.” 
He added that the offences contravened Sections 390(9) and 419 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun, 2006.
However, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge, hence, the Magistrate, Mrs A.O. Adeyemi, granted him bail in the sum of N100,000 with one surety in like sum.
The Magistrate also ordered that the surety must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and be gainfully employed with evidence of tax payment to the Ogun State government, while she adjourned the case till April 3, 2023 for further hearing.
