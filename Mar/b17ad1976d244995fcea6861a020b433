Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has sacked the Benue State Labour Party (LP) deputy governorship candidate, Idu Christopher Onyiloyi.  The candidate was subsequently replaced with Ochechi Godwin Adejor.  AIT reports that delivering judgment in a suit filed before the court by Adejor, Justice Ekwo held that Onyiloyi who personally wrote the Labour Party on the withdrawal of his candidacy and deposed to an affidavit as a legal backing ceased by law to hold the same status.  Justice Ekwo who based his judgment on sections 221 and 222 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and sections 29, 31, 32, 33 and 84 of the Electoral Act, 2022, ordered the Labour Party to immediately forward the name of Ochechi Adejor to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for publication as the party’s lawful deputy governorship candidate.  The Judge also issued an order compelling INEC to publish Adejor’s name and also restrained INEC from accepting any name other than Adejor as the party’s deputy governorship candidate in the state.
