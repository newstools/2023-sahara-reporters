Eyewitnesses said the incident occurred in the early hours of Monday, at Liberty Bus stop, Abakpa. Some hoodlums reportedly enforcing Monday’s sit-at-home have killed a yet-to-be-identified person and burnt two Sienna minivans and five commercial tricycles popularly called Keke Napep in Enugu, Southeast Nigeria.  The incident occurred in Abakpa in the Enugu East local government area of the state, according to Daily Independent.  Eyewitnesses said the incident occurred in the early hours of Monday, at Liberty Bus stop, Abakpa.  The armed men, according to the report, stormed the ever-busy bus stop at about 5.30 am, shooting indiscriminately to scare away the residents who were coming out of their houses for the day’s activities.  It was learnt that in the process, two Toyota Sienna minivans and tricycles whose owners had positioned to convey passengers from the area were burnt by the hoodlums.  The gunmen were said to have moved to the popular T-junction where they attempted to force an elderly man out of his car but ended up burning him along with the vehicle.  “They stopped the man and commanded him to step out of the car, the man resisted and that made the gunmen open the fuel tank, shot into the tank making the car to go up in flames with the man inside,” said an eyewitness, who added that the man was burnt to death.  SaharaReporters reports that residents of Enugu State following violent attacks on businesses have continued to obey the sit-at-home order.  The Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had since cancelled the sit-at-home observed in the Southeast states every Monday, saying such restrictions would be observed only on days Kanu would appear in court but Finland-based factional leader of the group, Simon Ekpa, has continued to order his armed gangs to enforce the order.
