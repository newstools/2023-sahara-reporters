The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has appealed to the Nigerian government to provide adequate security for corps members in the forthcoming governorship and State House of Assembly elections. The Director-General of the Scheme, Brigadier General Y. D. Ahmed, made the appeal on Tuesday while commending corps members for their performance during the Presidential and National Assembly elections.  Speaking at a meeting with all the NYSC State Coordinators in preparation for the forthcoming gubernatorial and State House of Assembly elections, Ahmed said the corps members who served as ad-hoc staff in the Presidential and National Assembly elections have written their names in gold in the annals of the history of the country as good ambassadors of the Scheme.  The Director-General said every stakeholder must rally around the Scheme in order to achieve its mandate, especially in the ongoing general elections.  He further appealed to members of the public to provide an enabling environment for the corps members to discharge their election duties, especially as the governorship and State House of Assembly elections draw near.  The DG also enjoined all state coordinators to sustain constant interface with relevant security agencies so as to ensure the safety of their corps members on election duty, including their welfare.  “I urge you to be committed to the general well-being of your staff and corps members. I also encourage you to uphold teamwork and lead with good examples in your respective state secretariats,” he said.
