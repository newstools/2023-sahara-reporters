This was stated by The National Chairman of the party, Julius Abure, in a statement, describing the election outcome as rape of democracy in the country. The Labour Party has rejected the result of Saturday's Presidential Election over alleged rigging by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC). 
This was stated by The National Chairman of the party, Julius Abure, in a statement, describing the election outcome as rape of democracy in the country. 
The LP chairman also said the results were manipulated after the people voted their choice.
On Wednesday morning, the Independent National Electoral Commission declared the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, the president-elect.
Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, was declared the president-elect after he polled 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election. 
Tinubu won the election ahead of other contenders  — the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar; the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi; and the New Nigeria Peoples Party candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso.
The three leading presidential candidates won in 12 states each while Kwankwaso claimed only Kano State.
Julius Abure, therefore, accused the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, of carrying out the rigging by refusing to upload results into its server.
Abure said the outcome only indicated that the government now runs a dictatorship, for refusing to listen to the voices of Nigerians.
