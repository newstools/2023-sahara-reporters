Reuters confirmed this from a spokesperson for the publication, urging the public to disregard it because it is not authentic.  A fact-checking report done by Reuters has revealed that a photo purporting to show Nigerian presidential candidate Peter Obi on the cover of the February 2023 edition of TIME magazine was fabricated. Reuters confirmed this from a spokesperson for the publication, urging the public to disregard it because it is not authentic. In an email to Reuters, a TIME spokesperson said: “This image is not an authentic TIME cover.” The cover page reads: “All eyes on Nigeria: Time for Africa’s sleeping giant to awaken. Peter Obi: His Labour party is favoured to win the Nigerian presidency. Are Nigerians finally ready to retire the old order and chart a new course?” This picture was shared widely on social media by various Nigeria celebrities who were ardent supporters of Peter Obi during last Saturday’s presidential election in the country. Charles Chukwuemeka Oputa, a singer popular known as Charly Boy, shared the fabricated image, saying, “Only 4 Nigerians have ever made the front page of TIME Magazine: Gowon, Sade Adu, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and now Peter Obi. Peter no be una mate biko.” Further finding shows that there was no cover featuring Obi in February 2023, per the publishing date on the image and a Google keyword search for the cover did not yield any results either. This false narrative spread after Nigerians voted in presidential elections on February 25. The Nigerian electoral commission on Wednesday declared Bola Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, as the president-elect after he polled 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election. Tinubu won the election ahead of other contenders — the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar; the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi; and the New Nigeria Peoples Party candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso.
