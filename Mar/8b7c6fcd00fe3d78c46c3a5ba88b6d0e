Fayose said his decision to quit the party appears to be connected with perceived irreconcilable differences which according to him, has fractured the party.  A former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has announced his resignation from the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He disclosed this while appearing as a guest on a programme on ARISE TV News on Wednesday night. Fayose said his decision to quit the party appears to be connected with perceived irreconcilable differences which according to him, has fractured the party. He however added that he wanted to become an elder statesman and would retire from active politics. “Let me say this, from today (Wednesday), I stay off PDP. In party politics, there are certain facts you must be able to speak. I am 62 and I can’t, at this age, begin lying. When something is wrong with your family, confess. “I’m retiring from active politics to become an elderly statesman,” he said. Fayose was one of the presidential hopefuls of the PDP but he lost to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar in the party’s primary election. Atiku lost the presidential election held last Saturday to Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress after polling 6,984,520 votes to come second behind the winner who polled 8,794,726 votes.
