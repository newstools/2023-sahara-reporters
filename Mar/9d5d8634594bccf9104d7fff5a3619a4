Same-sex relationships and marriages in Zambia are illegal and on Monday the government warned against the promotion of gay and lesbian rights, according to BBC News. Police in Zambia have arrested four women after they took part in a march against gender-based violence that also attracted LGBTQ-rights activists.  Same-sex relationships and marriages in Zambia are illegal and on Monday the government warned against the promotion of gay and lesbian rights, according to BBC News.  The four women, all aged under 30, have been charged with giving false information to public officers, and of holding an unlawful assembly, according to police spokesperson Danny Mwale.  The march which took place at the weekend was organised by Sistah Sistah Foundation, a local non-profit organisation. The organisation is also being investigated by the police.  It is believed that the protesters were allowed to march by the police because it was believed to be an anti-gender-based violence event, not to allegedly advocate gay and lesbian rights.  Some Zambians have criticised the march for this reason. But others who attended the march, or support its aims, remain defiant.
