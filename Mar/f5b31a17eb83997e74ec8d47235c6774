The foundation in a statement issued on Friday, signed by its Public Relations Officer, Emmanuel Ikechukwu, said it was worried that some political actors have refused to learn from the examples laid down by the incumbent governor of Enugu State, Dr Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi who had preached peace. Ahead of the March 11 governorship and House of Assembly elections in Enugu State, Nsukka Journalists Foundation (NJF) has raised grave concerns over the pervading atmosphere of violence in the Enugu North Zone of the state.  The foundation in a statement issued on Friday, signed by its Public Relations Officer, Emmanuel Ikechukwu, said it was worried that some political actors have refused to learn from the examples laid down by the incumbent governor of Enugu State, Dr Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi who had preached peace.  It described as disheartening and regrettable that political actors, particularly contestants in the elections, are approaching the race with the mindset of "guerillas going to war with enemies”.  The foundation said, "With rumours of political actors stockpiling weapons and mobilising thugs from within and outside the state pervading the social media and the gossip mill, the NJF wishes to caution all political actors and their associates of the dangers in adopting violence and threats of violence in an election designed to help us elect credible and responsible leaders to pilot the affairs of our dear state.  "We are also worried that some of our political actors have taken no lesson from the examples laid down by the incumbent governor of Enugu State, His Excellency, Dr Ifeanyi Lawrence Ugwuanyi, who has presided over the affairs of Enugu State for nearly eight years, with peace and brotherhood as his everyday mantra.  "We note that the Presidential and National Assembly elections, held on February 25, 2023, were largely peaceful and rancour-free, but we are worried that nearly all the conversations ahead of the March elections have moved from the expected campaign promises to the obnoxious languages of harassment and intimidation of opponents."  The group called on “all actors in the coming elections to eschew all forms of violence and threats of violence in thoughts, words and actions, and embrace the more noble and sportsmanly attitude to electoral contests, in line with the peaceful and fatherly disposition of His Excellency, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi”.  "We also call on our amiable governor to seize this pre-election period to sue for peace and invite all players and stakeholders to emulate the examples of peaceful coexistence that he has long laid in the state, and which is the greatest legacy he has laid for those who would come behind him,” it added.
