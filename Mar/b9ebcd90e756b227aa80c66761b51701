The hoodlums stormed the market around 2am on Wednesday and shot a security guard and two other persons before razing down the market's facilities. Some suspected political thugs have burnt down Akere spare parts market in the Apapa Ajegunle area of Lagos State. SaharaReporters gathered that the hoodlums stormed the market around 2am on Wednesday and shot a security guard and two other persons before razing down the market's facilities. In a video captured at the scene of the incident which was obtained by SaharaReporters, a man privy to the incident said, “A security man and two other guys were shot dead and they have gone to bury them immediately.” An official of the Red Cross at the scene also confirmed that the market was burned down but he did not provide further information on who was responsible. Reacting to the incident, an online user, identified as Frazee, said, “Akere spare parts market olodi Apapa is not so big because it’s in a residential area. So you have about two to three Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) members guarding the market at night. Igbos have become a target this period. “Politicians are really using brainwashed people to forment trouble. Burning people's means of livelihood just because of a stupid agenda is the lowest. In less than four months, the market will stand again, the people are so cooperative and financially strong.” “So it is just one security man that secures such a market? The Igbos in Lagos need to be more vigilant and security awake. The enemies of good governance are not going to be taking things easy with them. This is a fight they must win. If they don't successfully dislodge Lagos from the grip of these evil cartels come next gubernatorial poll, they will all be doomed,” another man, Pierocash added.
