 A former Kaduna State lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has warned security agents in the state to allow free governorship and State House of Assembly elections on Saturday. This is coming from Sani, a social activist after security agents in the state on Tuesday arrested the Media Director of the Kaduna State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Committee, Hon. Saidu Adamu, who is a former commissioner in the state. According to Senator Sani who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the 8th Assembly, the security agents also arrested two other youth leaders identified as El Abbas Muhammed and Talib Muhammed. Sani, who however did not reveal why the three persons were arrested said on his Twitter page, "Yesterday in Kaduna, security agents have arrested the Media Director of the State PDP campaign Committee, Hon. Saidu Adamu, an ex-Commissioner. "They have also arrested two youth leaders El Abbas Muhammed and Talib Mohammed. Security Agents should allow free elections in Kaduna." Sani added that "The APC lost election in Kaduna on the 25th of February; attempts to use security agents in order to intimidate and harass members of the opposition because of the 11th of March Governorship election will not be tolerated."
